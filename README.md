# Installation, Setup

## Installation (Linux only)
- If you're using Windows you can skip this chapter. You can simply install the game in Steam and you're good to go.
- Squad runs great on Linux too (through Steam and Proton). Since I play exclusively under Linux I wanted to share the setup process to make the life of other Linux users easier. I am using Manjaro, but the process should be the same on all distros.
    - Go to Steam and download Squad.
    - Start Squad and you'll get an EAC (Easy Anti Cheat) error. Click on OK and exit Squad.
    - Download Easy Anti Cheat from [Valve's Github repo](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/files/4839724/easyanticheat_wine_x64.tar.gz) - This is Valve's official repo and you won't get banned for playing under Linux.
    - Extract the files to: 
        - `/home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Application Data/EasyAntiCheat/55/`
        - If you installed Steam from Flatpak: `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Application Data/EasyAntiCheat/55/`
    - Set the /55/ directory to read-only
    - Also, set the following /Temp/ directory to read-only: 
        - `/home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Temp/`
        - If you installed Steam from Flatpak: `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Temp/`
    - In Steam go to Library " right-click on Squad " Properties " in the settings pop-up go to Compatibility and check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool". Select the latest Proton version.
    - While you're here, set Automatic Updates to "High Priority" and set background downloads to "Pause".
- In addition to Squad you can install the following tools to improve performance
    - [Proton GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)
    - [Feral Gamemode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)

### Controls
- Map: You will need the map A LOT. If you have a mouse with a thumb button this would be a good place to access the map. Or use TAB or any other key you can access without moving away from WASD too much.
- Lean keys: use Q to lean right, E to lean left - makes it easier to strafe at the same time.
- Check out my [Keyboard and Mouse Binds](https://github.com/SquadFM/Squad-Field-Manual/blob/main/Squad%20Keybinds.pdf).

## Backup Your Settings
- Backup your game settings (updates can reset your settings)
- Under Windows go to %localappdata%\SquadGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
- Backup the following files:
    - GameUserSettings.ini
    - Input.ini
- Under Linux you can find these two files in: /home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/SquadGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor/
- You can also record a video of your settings in-game using OBS - [OBS Setup](#obs-setup).


[Back to top](#content)


## Protect Your Hearing
- Shots and explosions can be very loud in Squad and damage your hearing.
- You can use an Audio Compressor that will automatically reduce volume spikes (e.g. shots, explosions).
- You will still be able to hear footsteps and other quiet noises. In fact, you will be able to focus better on quiet noises.
- The compressor will not just improve in-game sound, it will prevent damage to your ears. You do not want Tinnitus, it's terrible.

### Windows Audio Compressor
[VoiceMeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm)

### Linux Audio Compressor
- [PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects#installation)
- [PulseEffects-Legacy](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pulseeffects-legacy/)

| Setting Name 				| Value |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Attack					| 0ms |
| Release					| 100ms |
| Threshold				| -31db (if you reduce this towards 0db (e.g. -12db) loud noises will be louder) |
| Ratio					| 6 |
| Knee					| 0db |
| Makeup					| 0db |

## Fix Performance Issues
Performance issues can occur after Squad was updated. The following tips can help to improve performance.

### Show FPS, Find Hardware Bottlenecks
In the console type:
- stat FPS - to see frames per second
- stat Unit - to see if either the CPU or GPU are holding back performance. Stat Unit will display Frame, Game, Draw and GPU information.

| Value name | Value description |
| :--------- | :---------------- |
| Frame      | The total amount of time spent generating one frame of the game. |
| Game       | The game thread on the CPU. |
| Draw       | The render thread on the CPU. |
| GPU        | The time the GPU takes to render the scene. |

Whichever matches the Frame is what's holding performance back. If Frame time is very close to the Game time, you are bottlenecked by the game thread (CPU). If Frame time is very close to Draw time, you are bottlenecked by the rendering thread (again CPU). If neither time is close while GPU time is close, then you are bottlenecked by the video card. Some more technical information can be found here: [How to improve game thread CPU performance in Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/how-to-improve-game-thread-cpu-performance)

[Back to top](#content)


### Increase FPS With Image Upscaling

Image upscaling is a somewhat new feature of nVidia and AMD GPUs and can be used to run games in a lower resolution (therefore getting more FPS), and at the same time upscaling the image to look like a higher resolution (it will upscale the image to your screen's native resolution). This should be helpful for players especially with older GPUs to get more FPS in Squad.

#### Windows
Special thanks to Kevin who brought this topic to my attention and who provided the NVIDIA guide below.
- [NVIDIA Image Scaling](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5280/~/how-to-enable-nvidia-image-scaling) is a driver-based spatial upscaler and sharpener for GeForce GPUs for all games. This is a good tool to gain a considerable amount of FPS if needed.
- Enable NVIDIA image scaling in [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/). [[image](https://i.imgur.com/qG4P6mR.png)]
    - Choose either 85% / 77% / 67%. It is not recommended to go below 67%.
    - Take note of the resolution under the percentages, you will need to set your game resolution to this custom one.
    - Set sharpness to your own liking. A value between 20-50% is recommended.
- In the NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Image Scaling, tick the checkbox 'Overlay Indicator'. [[image](https://i.imgur.com/SHRBY0c.png)]
- In Squad its Graphic Settings, set Window Mode to Fullscreen and Resolution to one of the custom resolutions as seen in NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
- If everything is configured correctly you should see green NIS text in the upper left corner of your screen.
- [AMD user should be able to use this guide.](https://wccftech.com/heres-how-to-get-amd-fsr-running-in-any-game-using-lossless-scaling-tool/)

#### Linux
AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is an image upscaling algorithm that works with AMD and nVidia GPUs. 
- You'll need to install ProtonGE on your Linux distro to use FSR. [Find installation instructions here.](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) After ProtonGE was installed, you'll need to change a few things in Steam.
- In Steam > Library > right click on Squad > Properties > Compatibility: select Proton-GE
- In Steam > Library > right click on Squad > Properties > General > set the below launch options:
WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=0 %command%
- One note on "WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=0" - you can change the value from 0-5, whereas 0 sharpens the image the most, and 5 the least. I found 0 to improve image quality the most. You can also remove "WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=0" completely and FSR will use a standard value (which I believe is 2).
- Start Squad, go to Settings > Graphics and set Window Mode to "Fullscreen" (FSR will not work with borderless or windowed mode; this is the case in all games)
- Then set a resolution that is lower than your monitors native resolution in Squad's graphics settings (e.g., if your screen's native resolution is 1920x1080, set the in-game resolution for example to 1280x720).
- [Here's an image that shows recommended resolutions for different native screen resolutions.](https://gpuopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fsr_qualitytable_1200px.jpg) The closer the in-game resolution is to your screen's native resolution, the better the quality of the upscaled image will be. I have a 2560x1440p screen and 1920x1080p upscaled looked almost like 1440p ingame resolution. On the other hand 1280x720p upscaled to 1440p was quite blurry.
- If you want to find out if FSR is working, check if your screen is displaying its native resolution. You can also use [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) to display the resolution among other things (GPU% and CPU%, memory usage and more).

### XMP Memory Profile
- This is a setting that can be changed in your computers BIOS. It's usually not enabled by default.
- If XMP is disabled your RAM is running at less speed than it's capable of (usually 2133 MHz). Enabling this can gain you 10-20 FPS.
- Go into your BIOS and change the XMP to Profile 1. Save the settings and restart your computer.

[Back to top](#content)


### Reset Settings
- Some updates may change menu settings, graphic options, etc., and sometimes it is best to start with a clean slate. 
- Press "Empty Cache" in the Game Settings to reset everything to defaults. This will delete all of your keybinds, settings, etc.
- Alternatively, you can reset all Squad settings manually by deleting everything in the following folder. (Make a backup of everything you're going to delete first):
    - Under Linux: /home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/SquadGame/
    - Under Windows: %localappdata%\SquadGame\

[Back to top](#content)


### Sudden FPS Drops/Stuttering
- This appears to be a Linux specific bug that occurs when a new map loads. There's a thread on [Github](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/938).
- If you get a bad framerate after loading into a map or changing graphics settings, try opening the console and typing in "HighResShot 320x200" (without the " "). This command takes a screenshot, which causes some sort of a soft graphical reload that can solve the performance issue.
- Every time you execute HighResShot, a screenshot is being saved into the folder below. If you set the "Screenshots" folder to read-only, you don't have to remember to delete these screenshots.
    - Under Linux: /home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/393380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/SquadGame/Saved/Screenshots/
    - Under Windows: %localappdata%\SquadGame\Saved\Screenshots\
- Using the Linux tools below seems to improve performance and reduce these FPS drops.
    - [Proton GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)
    - [Feral Gamemode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
- Resolution Scale in Squads graphics options should not be set higher than 100, as a higher values appear to cause FPS drops that cannot be resolved with "HighResShot 320x200".

[Back to top](#content)


### Clear Shader Cache
- After every Squad update or if you experience performance issues, clear your shader cache. Before doing so, exit Squad. 
- Under Linux: 
    - Delete everything in this folder: /home/username/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/393380/
    - You can also use a cronjob to do this automatically every night or week.
    - There is also a way to disable Shader Pre-Caching in Steam under Settings " Shader Pre-Caching. You can test if turning these options off will enhance performance. 
- Under Windows: 
    - Open your Explorer, right­-click on the drive you have Windows installed.
    - Click on Properties.
    - Go to the General tab.
    - Click Disk Cleanup.
    - Mark the DirectX Shader Cache tickbox and confirm.
- Under Windows, you can also clear the NVIDIA shader cache
    - Go to your NVIDIA control panel " Manage 3D Settings " turn off Shader Cache and hit Apply.
    - Reboot your PC.
    - Go to %localappdata%\NVIDIA Corporation\NV_Cache and delete the contents of the folder (You can paste that address directly into a Windows address bar).
    - Go back to your NVIDIA control panel " Manage 3D Settings " turn On Shader Cache and hit Apply.
- Once you start Squad the game may stutter for a moment while the cache is being rebuilt, but this should only take a few seconds.

### Steam File Verification
- If you experience any performance issues, check the integrity of Squad's files.
- In Steam go to Library:
    - Right-click on Squad and click on "Properties"
    - Click on the "Local Files" submenu 
    - Click on "Verify integrity of game files"
    - The process usually takes a few minutes to complete.

[Back to top](#content)


### Remove Mods
- Mods can cause Squad to crash after major updates.
- Try to remove mods if you're experiencing issues that can't be resolved with any of the guides above.
- To remove mods, in Steam right click on Squad > Properties > Workshop and then unselect all mods.
- Alternatively, to remove mods from Squad, you can unsubscribe from these mods in the Steam Workshop:
    - Go to library and click on "Squad".
    - Click on "Workshop" in the vertical menubar.
    - Hover over "Your Files" near your avatar and click on "Subscribed Items"
    - Here you can see all subscribed items from the workshop, you can filter by game by selecting Squad in the filter option under your username.
    - Click on "Subscribed" to unsubscribe to the mods installed.

### Remove and reinstall Steam
- This may not be needed under Windows, but under Linux it has helped in the past.
- This is the nuclear option, and everything will be deleted. Therefore make a backup of your game files.
- Uninstall all Steam games and then uninstall Steam.
- Remove the Steam folder (under Linux /home/username/.local/share/Steam/). 
- Then reinstall Steam and Squad.

## OBS Setup
- If you don't want to record your games you can skip this chapter.
- OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is free software to record your gameplay. You can also use it to stream your games on various platforms.
- It's not needed to play Squad but I find it helpful to record games to review my performance.
- Share your Squad games and funny moments with the world on YouTube. We'd love to see them!
- You can download OBS for Windows/Linux [here](https://obsproject.com/).

# Before Joining A Game

- If you don't have a mic, get one. This game is all about communication. Also, know that text chat can be disabled. People may not see what you write (or they don't focus on text chat since they're busy attacking the enemy).
- Get a call sign that can be easily pronounced. It makes communication easier and it can help others to remember you more easily if you're interested in making friends. It's not super important, but it can help in situations where your SL or another friendly needs to address you quickly. You can search for "military call sign list" or check out [this site](https://henney.com/chm/callsign.htm) to get some inspiration. It doesn't even have to be a military call sign. Any easily pronounceable name or word will do.
- Try teamwork. It will make for a much better experience for everyone.
- The game has a learning curve but it's super rewarding once you're in the groove of things.
- Squad is about playing your role within a team. Sometimes that means rolling in kills, Squad-score, and glory. Sometimes that means sitting on a hill for 30 minutes watching the world go by. Remember: it’s not all about you. It's about the team.
- When you’re playing Squad, whatever you’re doing and whatever your role is, your actions should be, in some way, related to the team’s objectives and/or the objectives of the particular game mode that you’re playing. Check out [Game Mechanics](#game-mechanics) and [Game Modes](#game-modes) to learn more about how this game works.
- Think about the objectives constantly and ask yourself: "Is what I am doing right now positively contributing to the team?", "What could I be doing better?", "What could we be doing better?". This focus on playing the objective should be your preeminent concern for the entire round. Irrespective of what the 40 other players on your team are doing, you can make a difference by playing the objective. Sometimes, one player is all it takes to tip the balance in a firefight, on a flag zone, or at a FOB. Get your arse onto the point. Get behind some cover. Dig in. Help out.
- Your first 20 hours will be about learning and making mistakes. You have to go through it. It gets fun when you know the basics.
- Also you should know you are not the slave of the squad you joined. If you don't like your SL or teammates join another squad. Play with a squad that sticks together. Also, if you choose the rifleman or medic role instead of HAT or MG your SL will have less expections from you.
- You may meet shitty people (like in any game), but fortunately, they're very much the minority in the Squad community. Much like other games, there are a few loudmouth assholes, and a shitload of friendly players who're happy to help you learn.

## Training
- Complete the in-game training. Then do it again. 
- Practice on Jensen's Range and practice a lot! Try weapons, mortars, tanks, fly the helicopter, have fun and explore everything. Get used to rifle optics and see how far you can hit targets.
- If you want to train on a different map than Jensen's Range, open your console and type AdminChangeLayer. A list will show up with all maps and game modes and you can choose one of them. If the map has a timer that prevents you from getting into a vehicle or flying the helicopter open your console and type AdminSlomo 150, which will speed up time. You can set time back to normal with AdminSlomo 1.
- Useful Console Commands:
    - AdminChangeLayer (and the map of your choice)
    - AdminDisableVehicleClaiming 1 (allows you to claim any vehicle)
    - AdminAlwaysValidPlacement 1 (allows you to place anything you want)
    - AdminSlomo 20 (speeds or slows in-game time; set to 1 for normal time)
    - AdminCreateVehicle <vehicle> 
        - for example to spawn a Leopard 2 type: AdminCreateVehicle /CanadianArmedForces/Vehicles/Leopard2/BP_2A6_Desert.BP_2A6_Desert_C
        - find a complete list of spawnable vics here: https://squad.fandom.com/wiki/Server_Administration#Vehicle_Spawn_Commands
- You can explore a map with Shift + P. Move around with your usual movement keys. Find more information below under [Admin Camera](#admin-camera).
- Want to check out being a Squad Leader? Create a squad in the deployment menu (just name a squad and you'll be SL). Make sure to grab the SL kit from an ammo box. You can use map markers and place structure foundations (though you'll need a non-SL role to build them. The SL does not have a shovel).
- Want to be a Commander and call in airstrikes? Create a squad first, then click on "Volunteer as Commander" and get your binos out, open your radial menu and click on "Request Tactical Support from Commander". Then go to the deployment screen and approve the request (right mouse click on the target area).

## Good Roles And Jobs For New Players
- [Rifleman](#rifleman) (suggested role for your first few games)
- [Medic](#medic)
- [Automatic Rifleman](#automatic-rifleman)
- Logi Runs
    - Bring build and ammo supplies to the FOB.
    - Tell your SL that you volunteer for logi runs. Learn how to drive a truck first and how you can load/unload it.
    - Logi runs are a great way to learn maps and have a positive impact on the game. No victory without supplies.
[Back to top](#content)


## Finding a Server
- First, join Jensen's Range (the map where you train). Then search for a server. Most good servers are usually full and have a waiting list and you have to wait a few minutes. While you wait for the server to connect, you can train on Jensen's Range. The game will connect you automatically to the server once it has a spot for you.
- For your first game: Jump on a full server (you might need to wait a few minutes in the queue, that's fine. Preferably you should join a server in your native language to make communication easy. Join a Squad. If none are open, be patient, there will be one available in a few minutes. Have fun! Tell your Squad Leader you are new and need guidance. Follow your SLs orders and kick some ass.
- Ping is not super important in Squad. You will still have a good experience with a 150 ping.
- Many servers specifically say something like "New Players Welcome". Those can be a good place to start, but be aware that people may not play Squad like it is supposed to be played (it can be a shit show - but it may be a good place to practice certain aspects of the game). If you want to play Squad like it's supposed to be played find a server that isn't targeted to new players. As always, your mileage may vary (e.g. depending on time of day).
- Pick a server with the game mode AAS or RAAS. Maps and game modes usually change every round. You will most likely join an ongoing game.

[Back to top](#content)


## Server Rules
- Be aware that all servers have rules. Make sure to follow these rules. Violations can result in bans.
- If other people are harassing you, you can send admins a message (open the console and type ChatToAdmin "message") or ask your SL for help.
- Most servers' rules most likely are similar to the ones below:
    - Be friendly, stay calm, help new people, have fun.
    - Squad Leaders must use a mic, speak English and make an effort to communicate.
    - Do not teamkill or intentionally wound a friendly player. Mistakes happen. If it was an accident, immediately apologize in all chat.
    - All vehicles requiring the Crewman kit need to be 2 manned (unless they are being returned to base).
    - We have zero-tolerance for racism or griefing or confrontation. Do not make things personal, degrading, or confrontational on our server.
    - No locked 1 man squads (except logistics).
    - Do not create a squad if you don't intend to lead it.
    - If you want to use a vehicle, but other people are already waiting, get in line and wait your turn.

[Back to top](#content)


# Joining a Squad
- Join a Squad that has "INF" in its title, or does not have "ARMOR" or "HELI" in its title. If a squad has a not-so-serious name it's usually a good team to join. Those are often led by experienced SLs that just want to have a good time. Should you end up in the wrong squad, the SL will most likely let you know and you can switch to another one.
- Do not create your own squad yet, unless you know the game inside out. Play all roles in live games first before you lead a Squad.
- Pick the Rifleman kit. This kit comes with an ammo bag that you can share with your team (e.g. your Medic can refill their bandages and HAT/LAT can get more rockets).
- Get a weapon with a magnified optic on it. You will be at a severe disadvantage without a magnified optic. For close-quarter battles, an iron sight may be better, but don't worry about this yet.
- Find a good squad that is talking and is willing to help. If you find that people don't communicate (especially SL) consider joining another squad. However, sometimes it's fun to stay in these squads and to join random firefights, explore the map, and try new kits.
- You can tell if your SL is good based on
    - Communication - he/she is talking to you guys but not too much
    - Clear orders
    - Map markers
    - Picking fireteam leads
    - Telling people to swap kits to round out the squad
    - Helping you guys adding value to the team
- There are rarely toxic people in Squad. If you come across anyone being too noisy you can mute them. You can find the mute button on the scoreboard. There's a little speaker by their name on the list. Click on it.
- If people are racist/abusive let your SL know. Also, report them to the server’s admin. Those people usually get banned. To reach an admin type this in your console: ChatToAdmin your message here.
- If the game is already going on, ask SL where you should spawn, before you deploy.
- When you join a game and a squad at game start, don't instantly spawn in. Wait a polite 10-20 seconds for the squad to fill and the SL to open his mouth. For several reasons. (1) The SL may be a shitbag that passes the kit over in 5 seconds which results in a hot potato squad and ruins the match start. (2) The SL may be micless and/or clueless. You want to avoid that. (3) The SL may have plans that don't involve all 9 squad members spawning straight away, you take this option away by running out and spamming F on a logi.
- Ask SL for vehicle permission BEFORE spawning at main. If your SL doesn’t want you to use it and/or wants you somewhere else you are either stuck at main waiting for a ride or have to waste a ticket to respawn.
- Follow the Squad Leaders orders and stay close to your squad unless told otherwise.
- Follow someone. If you are a Rifleman try to follow your squad’s anti-tank guy(s) because they will need your ammo bag. Often, your SL will put you in a fireteam together with a LAT/HAT guy and a Medic.

[Back to top](#content)


## Communication
- Use your mic. To speak with your squadmates or friendlies close by you need to press and hold a button (check your keybinds).
- Say 'hi' to your squadmates. You may be the first person to break the ice. If the squad is all clammed up, someone saying anything can help kick start the comms and the banter. Be positive and be confident. If you’re not, wing it.
- Tell your squad that you're new to the game.
- Ask questions. People are usually willing to help.
- If someone talks to you, talk back. Act like you're in the real world and not a video game.
- Chit-chatting and making jokes while you're on your way to the first objective is usually fine. But listen to your SL if they want to tell you about the objective.
- Tell your SL/Team if you had a good time. Squad leading is hard work and showing some appreciation can brighten someone's day. Also, you can ask your SL if they're leading again next round in case you want to continue gaming.

## I Am Too Shy To Speak
- If you're shy you're in a great place. This is a perfect game for you. It will improve your confidence in talking with others greatly. Try it.
- Squad helped a lot of people overcome their shyness and also helped many players learn to speak more confidently in English.
- The community is very welcoming and you're most likely surrounded by other shy people (that may or may not yet be comfortable to speak into their mic).
- Just start with enemy callouts. This and following orders is a Squad Leader's dream.
- No one will call you out for not chatting about random stuff.

[Back to top](#content)


## I Cannot Speak (I Am A Mute)
- Send a quick message to your squad when you join that you can't use your voice due to medical reasons.
- If you run into an asshole, let the admins know.
- Play Medic for absolutely no need to talk. Most other classes other than Command or scouting don't really need talking unless you see something.
- While speaking is helpful, even more important is following orders and playing as a squad.
- There are plenty of squads without speaking. These are the squads where the SL is just a filler and isn't really a Squad Leader. They don't care if you can speak or not.
- Be aware that not a lot of people read text chat a whole lot or quickly enough. Text chat can also be disabled in the UI, so some people won't see chat messages at all.
- You could set up a soundboard to play the most common phrases (take a look at the [Callouts](#callouts) chapter). You can download the Soundux Soundboard [here](https://soundux.rocks/). It's free software for Windows and Linux.


[Back to top](#content)


## Callouts
- Don't get caught up in speech or slang. Clear quick and precise information is important, not how you say it. 
- Always identify yourself and never say “me”. 
- Use the appropriate voice channel.
- Before you use voice chat remember this: A.B.C. Accuracy, Brevity, Clarity. Your Squad Leader will thank you, and the rest of the squad will too.
- Always check your map to see if you're looking at an enemy or friendly soldier.
- Don't ever say "101 degrees" in squad chat. Any degree direction in squad chat is useless and anybody not in local range will just get a confusing direction to look at. Stick to local chat for degree information.
- Don't say "Enemy on me". Not in local chat and especially not in squad chat. Other players do not know who said: "On me". If they are quick enough to spot your name in the voice chat notification they would still have to open their map and then find where you are. Say at least "Enemy on YOURNAMEHERE's position" and give some indication of where you are. 
	- To describe where you are, use:
		- landmarks (e.g. bridge, village, mountain)
		- features of the map (water tower, radio antenna, police station, main road, etc.)
		- your SLs position
		- cap zones
		- on where you are relative to your other squad members
	- For example:
		- "I am west of the bridge"
		- "I am 50m south of SLs position"
		- "Enemy armor spotted, south of Market, approx. 100 meters"
		- "Enemy squad approaching our defense flag from the west"
		- "Enemy vehicle north of Squad Leader"
		- "I am the most northern squad member"
- If you're incapacitated you could say "I'm down. Enemy on YOURNAMEHERE's position" on local voice chat. Your SL or FTL can use their map and look for a faded arrow (faded green if it's someone from your own squad, otherwise faded blue) and hover over it to see if it's you and mark it. However, it's usually best to give some indication of where you are (especially over squad chat).
- FTLs should mark any callouts on the map to decrease SL load.
- The map is split up into grids. A grid is a network of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines used to identify locations on a map.  Each grid has a number and a letter, which you can see on the edge of the map, A1 being top left and J10 being bottom right. 
- Each of these grids is further divided into subgrids, called keypad. Keypad is a subdivision of the grid location which is numbered like the layout of a keypad on your PC keyboard. 1 is bottom left, 3 is bottom right, 7 is the top left, 9 is the top right, and 5 is in the center. Just like the 1-9 on your keyboard numpad. It allows you to very quickly give a precise location.
- Grid locations should be used rarely. It's time-consuming to bring up the map and to figure out what grid you're referring to. Better to say "Enemy BTR north-west of the objective, on the road" rather than "Enemy BTR A5-6-4". Grid coordinates are handy though when there's an enemy HAB somewhere without any landmarks to reference.
- Call vehicles out to teammates and SL with the minimum information you know. Does it have tracks? Mention that. Which way is it moving? Etc.
- The more effective you can communicate the location of the enemy, the more quickly and more efficiently that you and your team can deal some death in their direction. Weight of fire and accuracy of fire wins firefights.
- The basic format of a target indication is simple
    - Distance (Make an approximate guess about the range. This is not vital and can be left out in a desperate situation.)
    - Direction
    - Reference
    - Type of enemy
- So, to put this into practice
    - CONTACT! 100 meters (Distance)
    - 300 degrees (Direction - use the compass at the bottom of your screen)
    - Top of feature (Reference)
    - 2 infantry (tanks, APCs, HMGs, whatever) in the open! (Type of enemy)
- In the heat of battle you’re never going to get the format absolutely perfect. And that doesn’t matter. What’s important is that you convey the relevant information: How far away are the enemies? In what direction? What is the enemy? And how can I help my buddies find the enemy?
- Examples Local Voice Channel:
    - CONTACT! 300 degrees ... Top of the ridge ... 2 enemies in the open ... About 100 meters
    - CONTACT! 2 enemies ... 100 meters ... Top of the feature ... At 300 degrees from my position!
    - CONTACT! 100 meters ... 2 guys with AKs ... 300 degrees ... Watch my splash! (proceeds to smash 100 rounds from the SAW in their direction)
    - 2 infantry north of YOURNAMEHERE position
    - Contact South, at 190, infantry
    - Contact North, 13 degrees
    - Contact on our right/left/on the rooftop
    - Enemy squad flanking from the bridge
- Examples Squad Voice Channel:
    - "Tank 200m west of village. Sector F-4 keypad 3."
    - "Tank in F4, keypad 4"
    - "Enemies on the bridge"
    - "Enemy FOB in the house in G6 Keypad 5!"
    - "Tank 100m West of tower moving from South to East"
- More Generalized Callouts
    - North, South, East, West
    - Intersection, T-junction
    - Left Flank (Left side), Right Flank (Right side)
    - Rear, 6 o'clock (Behind)
    - Upstairs (Above), Downstairs (Below)
    - Entrance (Way in), Exit (Way out)
    - Door, Window, Room, Rooftop, Deck (Floor), Overhead
      (Ceiling), Hallway
    - Trench, Ditch
    - Hill
    - Gun (weapon/turret emplacement)
    - Nest (turret/emplacement position)
    - Fort (Defend-able structure built for war)
    - Road, Path
    - Clearing
    - Forest, Tree-line
    - River, Moat
    - Mountain, Ridge line
    - Chasm, Deep trench, Ravine
    - Hole, Pitt

## Lyrics
- You're probably wondering why there's a chapter called "Lyrics" in this guide.
- Let me tell you, this is a very important chapter. Maybe one of the most important ones.
- Imagine at the start of the match you and your squad load up in a truck and you're heading off down the road. After a little chitchat, someone starts softly singing "Take Me Home, Country Roads" from the very beginning of the song. Everyone stops talking, then someone joins in. By the time he gets to the chorus everyone in the truck is singing along... Your whole squad just road tripping through a forest singing together. Beautiful moments like these make Squad a very special game.
- Learn to sing the songs below (very badly is fine) or keep the lyrics handy :)

```
Take Me Home, Country Roads - John Denver

    Almost Heaven, West Virginia
    Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
    Life is old there, older than the trees
    Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

    Country roads, take me home
    To the place I belong
    West Virginia, mountain mama
    Take me home, country roads

    All my memories gather 'round her
    Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
    Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
    Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

    Country roads, take me home
    To the place I belong
    West Virginia, mountain mama
    Take me home, country roads

    I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
    The radio reminds me of my home far away
    Driving down the road, I get a feeling
    That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

    Country roads, take me home
    To the place I belong
    West Virginia, mountain mama
    Take me home, country roads
    Country roads, take me home
    To the place I belong
    West Virginia, mountain mama
    Take me home, country roads

    Take me home, (Down) country roads
    Take me home, (Down) country roads
```

```
Fortunate Son - Creedence Clearwater Revival

    Some folks are born made to wave the flag
    Ooh, they're red, white and blue
    And when the band plays Hail to the Chief
    Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no senator's son, son
    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no fortunate one, no

    Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
    Lord, don't they help themselves, no
    But when the taxman come' to the door
    Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no millionaire's son, no no
    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no fortunate one, no

    Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes
    Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
    And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
    Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!"

    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no military son, son, Lord
    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no fortunate one, one
    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
    It ain't me, it ain't me
    I ain't no fortunate son, no no no
```

## Radio
- Wherever your squad wants to create a new FOB, your SL needs to place a radio. Within a radius of 150m of this radio, your squad can build structures.
- The radio hub can be incapacitated by firepower above a certain caliber or dug down by a holding down right-mouse-click with the Entrenching tool (shovel). Satchel charges set by a Combat Engineer and Sapper or the improvised explosive device set by a Sapper are also very effective at lowering the health of the radio hub. Deconstructing the radio hub to below 75% will make the Spawn Bunker unspawnable.
- Once incapacitated the friendly team has 60 seconds to rebuild the radio before it is destroyed. The timer can be stopped by building the radio back up to a certain threshold, the radio does not have to be fully rebuilt in these 60 seconds. During this time the enemy team cannot destroy the radio and must defend the radio while the timer is running, friendlies are the only players able to destroy the radio while this timer is running.
- Once destroyed, all tech structures and emplacements placed within a radio hub's build vicinity will be destroyed as well. Fortifications such as sandbags and HESCO blocks will remain. If an enemy player destroys your radio hub, your team will lose 10 tickets.
- Only a Squad Leader with a Squad Leader kit can place a radio hub and is accessed through the deployables menu by pressing T. To place a radio hub, the Squad Leader requires one other member from the team to be nearby and a logistics vehicle to be within 30 meters. Also, a radio hub cannot be placed within 300 meters from another radio hub. This radius can be displayed on the map from the drop-down menu. Once placed, the radio hub can then be supplied by a logistics vehicle with construction and ammo points. These points show on top o the screen when a player is within the 150-meter build radius. Unlike deployable assets, a radio hub does not need to be constructed with an entrenching tool.
- If construction points are available, the Squad Leader can then place deployable assets within the 150-meter build radius, which then need to be constructed by other team members with the Entrenching tool. When construction and ammo points are depleted, a logistics vehicle will need to deliver supplies from the main base to continue building and resupplying ammunition.

[Back to top](#content)


## Building Deployables
- Deployables are structures that Squad Leaders can deploy within the 150-meter build radius of a Forward Operating Base. 
- Your SL can only place the structures' foundation and will need your help to build it. Approach the foundation and get your shovel out and start building with your left mouse button. The right mouse button removes the structure (don't do that unless told to by your SL).
- Fireteam Leads can also place fortification structures.
- For each FOB you will most likely build a HAB and an ammo box. The radio, as mentioned above, does not need to be built.
- You can help other squadmates to build a structure. More shovels build faster.
- Make sure you're standing OUTSIDE the deployable or your teammates will bury you inside it. You will be alive, but you won't be able to go anywhere. 
- If you see enemy structures you can remove them with your shovel. Approach the structure and use your right mouse button.

[Back to top](#content)


## Supplying a FOB (aka Logi runs)
- If your truck already carries supplies (ammo, build material) you can drop them off within 150m of a radio. 
- You can be inside/outside the truck and press F, then at the bottom of the wheel there are options to unload either ammo or build (keep holding F and move your mouse on one of the buttons and left-click). 
- More people loading/unloading will get the job done faster.
- Bring the empty truck back to main base and press F again to load ammo/build. 
- You might want to load 1800 build and 1200 ammo to build 3 HABs (HAB = 500 build,  ammo box = 100 build; and 400 ammo per HAB). 
- Coordinate with your SL and ask what they prefer.

[Back to top](#content)


## Running Around
- Avoid the compulsion to run around all the time, movement is easily spotted by the human eye. If you are close to enemies, move slowly.
- Stop every now and then and try to spot enemy movements.
- Check the map often for intel and to get your bearings. Also, to see where friendlies are and if you have an enemy in front of you.
- Manage your Stamina. It's the bar that's being depleted when you sprint. Without stamina aiming and hitting something is nearly impossible. Stop sprinting when you approach an area with enemies so that your stamina can replenish.
- If you hear enemy weapons nearby in the direction your headed stop and try to figure out another route, maybe you can flank them.
- Never profile yourself on top of a hill unless absolutely necessary. You should try to use the terrain as cover as much as possible.
- It's often better to take a slightly longer route in cover than it is to take the shorter one across an open area.
- Moving across an open area is how you die. Run fast or smoke to conceal your movement. Let smoke plume before you move.
- When crossing terrain, choose paths of movement that minimize your exposure to any potential snipers. Always move in a way that puts you near buildings and environmental objects you can put between you and your attacker and use as cover if you get surprised or ambushed. You know how rats and mice in houses will run along the edges of the wall and behind things to try to stay hidden as they travel, you gotta be like that. You gotta be the rat.
- Don't get discouraged if you don't know the maps or where you are getting shot from. You will learn the maps while playing.
- Stick together - This isn't Call Of Duty. This isn't even Battlefield. You need to stick with your squad. Especially Medics. I understand if we just met up with another squad and they need medical attention but as soon as their Medic is up regroup with your squad. I've had countless times where my Medics are 200-300 yards away busy healing another squad when I need them on my own squad members. Also, this game is called Squad for a reason. Teamwork is essential! Sure you may get a lot of kills as a lone wolf but you aren't helping the team when the objective is lost because you could have been the one guy that noticed a whole enemy squad coming up on the back.

[Back to top](#content)


## Map
- Rebind your map key so that you can reach it easily. Use a mouse thumb button or a key close to WASD.
- Red markers on the map mean enemies, but they are placed by players. This means enemies could be anywhere near there.
- Use your map to make an educated guess on where the enemy is, and when you need to be vigilant, which direction you should be watching, etc.
- Find out where your teammates are looking. They are usually looking towards the enemy in a firefight.
- If you're SL or fireteam lead you can place markers on the map.
- You probably heard something like "Enemy grid Alpha 3, subkey 4, 6" This is referencing the grids on the map, if you hover over a grid at the bottom right it shows the grid (ie Alpha 3-4-6). The largest grid would be Alpha 3, then inside that grid is another smaller grid (subkey 4) and inside that grid is an even smaller grid (6).
- You can use the map coordinate grid for callouts (e.g. "Tank in F-8").
- Each grid has a smaller sub-grid. The smaller one consists of 9 squares and is called Keypad. It is read from 1 to 9 like the numerical keypad on your PC keyboard. The square in the lower left is 1, the square in the upper right is 9.
- If you hover with your mouse over a grid you will see the actual position of your mouse. When you open the minimap by running you will see your player position on the left up corner.

## Identifying The Enemy
- Learn which uniforms, weapons, and vehicles each faction uses. Also, learn to identify weapons and vehicles by their sound. This will make it easier to identify enemies and what vehicle is approaching your position.
- Study the faction uniforms on the team selection screen. This screen can be accessed during the game from the deployment menu.
- Identify something that's both easy to remember and easy to differentiate between the two teams. This is usually something like overall uniform color, brightness, or camo pattern. For example: "the enemy is lighter," or "the enemy is darker green," or "the enemy camo is more splotchy." These generalizations are especially useful at the beginning of the round when you haven't seen the enemy on the battlefield yet.
- Find finer details about the enemy uniform that can help identify them. These are usually harder to spot in the field, but can still be helpful. For example: "the enemy all wear dark sunglasses." Ideally, look for traits that aren't shared with any of the kits in your faction.
- Take a close look at a downed enemy. This is even more effective if you can see one of your teammates near the corpse at the same time.
- Check your map often to see where friendlies are and are not. When looking at the map, I try to make generalizations or rules of engagement about the battlespace around me. For example: "there are no friendlies to the west." This understanding allows me to open fire immediately if I see any units to my west. These rules are often very short-lived, so I open my map frequently to revalidate them or define new ones.
- Make liberal use of the scroll wheel when using the map. Changing the zoom level provides useful adjustments to the level of detail and context provided by the map. I zoom out to make more strategic decisions about where to move, attack or defend. For more tactical decisions and actions, I zoom in as far as I can so that I can take notice of nearby threats, friendlies, and environmental features that can provide cover and concealment.
- The map and scroll wheel also help me with vehicle identification. If I hear a vehicle or helicopter, I quickly open the map, zoom out, and look for green or blue vehicles in the vicinity. If I don't see any, then I take cover and proceed accordingly.
- If you're still in doubt, wait for verification from the friendly player name tag. Note that the tags don't always show up or are often hard to see.
- You will still make mistakes occasionally and fire on friendlies. When this happens, be sure to apologize, and do your best to revive them if they're down. If you TK someone type in the console ChatToAll Sorry for TK. Admins see that you killed a team member and if they see an apology they know it was not intentional. They can miss apologies via voice channel, therefore always apologize via text chat.
- Staying still and watching for moving pixels is the best way to spot enemies.
- Call Contacts - You shouldn't shoot at an enemy unless you've been given the clear to fire. One of the things a lot of new players don't realize is you may want to get the kill but then no one knows where you're shooting. You need to call out the contacts using the compass at the bottom of your screen like "Contact at 330". Saying "Contact left" isn't going to do anything to help and so is just shooting at an enemy. Now on the not firing until given the okay to shoot, you don't necessarily know what your SL is trying to do and when you shoot and give away your position you may have just messed up the SL's plan to sneak around the enemy flank.

## Firefights
- Any time you are under fire you need to be shooting back, it is the only chance you have in some cases. This game is centered around one of the best suppression models I have seen to date in a game. If you are being shot at, shoot back. Can't see them? Guess. You might be right. If anything it might get the enemy's head down and gives you a chance. The moment you return fire, even if just in the direction of fire, you created a 2-way firing range, and the entire tempo has changed. You now have him surprised, off guard, possibly suppressed, maybe wounded, or even dead with enough lead and luck.
- Don't be too far away from or right on top of teammates when attacking and defending.
- As for spotting enemies, look for movement, not shapes.
- Always use single fire. In CQB (e.g. in a building) autofire can make sense.
- Hide behind cover and use your lean keys to expose less of your body.
- Someone shoots at you? Don't fret, and don't immediately go prone, and don't immediately go to your bandage unless your screen is blood red and you are about to die. Instead, try to move to cover quickly, dodge back and forth to make their next shots miss, and with each shot, you coerce out of them, you get more information about where you are being engaged from. Get to cover, then bandage.
- When you're running for cover use your freelook button and look around where the shots are coming from.
- Tracers work both ways. You can see where your shots land and the enemy can see where they're coming from.
- Change position every now and then after you shoot. Once a single enemy soldier knows where you are they will let their team know. Peeking the same angle on an enemy again is how you die.
- To get an accurate range ask the SL or an FTL to tag a specific spot to get an exact distance. Otherwise, if you can see an enemy player, most scopes/binoculars in the game give you a way to estimate the range.
- ADS before peeking or rounding cover - This tip is mainly applicable to scoped weapons. Being zoomed in simply gives you a closer look at a target, making it easier to identify them as friend or foe. Aiming down sights doesn't happen instantly, and you don't want to lose that precious time if you round a corner and come face to face with an enemy.
- If you are dying constantly it is probably because of positioning and awareness
    - You are moving past an enemy position you don't know about
    - You aren't moving close enough to cover
    - You are visible from too many sides
- Do not waste TOW/Kornet (the guided rockets) shots on infantry
- Watch out for IED bikes and drones. If a bike is making a beeline for you, shoot that guy immediately.
- Learn to identify where the incoming fire is coming from by listening. Bullets move faster than the speed of sound, so if you get shot at, you'll first hear the supersonic crack of the bullet passing by you, and then you'll hear the dull "thump" of the rifle that fired it. If you hear a crack, get ready to listen for the thump.
- Hold your fire if you spot a group of enemies in the distance. Let soldiers around you know (local com), let your squad know if it's an armored vehicle (squad com). If possible let enemies come closer or let them move to a position where they hardly find cover. Coordinate the attack with soldiers around you.
- If you get pinned down, you will lose. Anytime you are in a small area defending, it's only a matter of time until you will lose. Trying to defend the point? Push OFF the point. If you stay on the point, you will eventually lose it. Too many people are too scared and get pinned down immediately, and you end up with 10 players within 20m who are completely combat ineffective. Getting pinned down? Quit attacking in the same linear direction as your entire team and flank.
- Suppressive fire is underutilized and extremely powerful. If you get shot at close to you, what is your default reaction? You go prone and/or take cover. You become combat ineffective. All it takes is a close shot - not a hit. Guess what - it's the same for the enemy. People don't utilize this enough. You can put a few shots into a window at long range and the person who was holding the angle will forfeit it - allowing you to push them. If the enemy is somewhere in a building, put one shot every second into one window, then the next, then the next, then the next. 30 seconds of a person not shooting back. You can suppress whole squads with one rifleman doing this.
- Suppressive fire is not a mag dump. It is not 30 round bursts from an AR/MMG. Suppressive fire is one or two shots a second (maybe 5 or 6 if using an AR/MMG) in the general direction of the enemy. You don't need cover fire that is a 10-second stream of automatic fire and then a reload. You put slow, consistent fire downrange - and the enemy keeps their damn head down.
- Use your smokes. It's the single biggest advantage you have when advancing. Smoke removes the defender’s ability to see your advance.
- "I'm up, he sees me, I'm down" - is a marine tactic and it works well. Move from cover to cover, from concealment to concealment with this. It means - make bounds, wait, scan, look, bound again. Expose yourself for a few seconds, then get back in cover. Say it out loud or in your head and you'll get the idea of how long it's realistic to be in the open.
- Check out the chapter on how to [How To Identify A Vehicle](#how-to-identify-a-vehicle) and [How to Destroy/Disable A Vehicle](#how-to-destroydisable-a-vehicle).

## I'm Dead, Now What?
- Not dead yet and still on your feet? You'll bleed at 0.3 health points per second until bandaged.
- Stamina will not regenerate if your health is less than 5 health points.
- If you're shot and on the ground wait for a Medic. If no one is close to you ask SL where to spawn.
- Say "Thank you" if the Medic fixes you up (or dies trying).
- Don’t click the "Call Medic" button as it’ll alert enemies in the area to your/the Medic’s presence. Instead, call teammates via local chat because the enemy can’t hear that.
- However, you can use the Medic call to bait enemies. Just spam it if you are alone and maybe the enemy will wonder if people are still near you.
- Also don’t give up when there are teammates nearby. You have 5 minutes until you die. Even if it seems impossible to be picked up now, a lot can happen in 5 minutes and the coast will probably be clear to be picked up in a bit. Be patient, it’ll save you time & tickets.
- However, sometimes respawning quickly and throwing away a ticket to win an objective can make sense. Sometimes you need pressure, especially on Invasion defense. Check with your SL.
- When the Medic heals you, give cover and look for enemies, don't look at the Medic. Also, try to stay in place so the Medic can properly heal you and doesn't have to follow you around (this can lead to both you and the Medic getting killed).
- If a friendly is dead you can drag them by their feet/shoulders. Approach them crouched and press F to drag them.
- Drag downed players to cover, so your Medic does not have to risk their life and can focus on healing.
- If no Medic is close by, use your own bandages to get a downed player back on their feet. You can refill bandages from a Rifleman's backpack.

## Tactical Respawning
- Sometimes it is smarter to die and spawn shift to the next cap than to sit on a point your team just captured. Ideally, leave all enemies on that useless cap point behind while spawn shifting onto the next offensive point.
- Walking 100m takes ~30 seconds and sprinting ~20 seconds, so balance that with respawning. Travelling takes time and sometimes you're needed somewhere else immediately.
- If you're in the middle of nowhere and you need to get back to a FOB, open the console and type Respawn. This will kill you and your team will lose a ticket, but you can spawn where you're needed.

[Back to top](#content)


## Being a Fireteam Lead
- You can hold T to open the radial menu and place markers on the map (e.g. attack marker).
- You can give fireteam lead to someone else on your fireteam.
- Leapfrog with the other fireteam on your squad to move around.
- Mark any callouts you hear over voice vom on the map to decrease SL load.

[Back to top](#content)


## What If I'm Given SL?
- If your Squad Leader leaves the squad the first person that joined the squad will automatically be given SL. This usually happens if your SL was an asshat. Best practice would have been for the SL to ask who wants to be the new SL instead of just abandoning the squad.
- If you're a new player, ask your team who wants to be SL and hand it over to them in the deployment menu (right-click on their name).
- If you want to remain SL, get an SL kit ASAP. Additionally, teach the person who gave you SL a lesson and kick them from your squad.
- Also, check out the [Squad Leading](#squad-leading) tips below.

[Back to top](#content)


## Best Practices
- Ideally don't change kits in the field - this causes the ammo on FOBs to melt away fast (even though 80% is being refunded). Change kits ideally at main. In the same vein, changing kits to solve a problem is fine. Your squad desperately needs a Medic, a Crewman to repair a vehicle, or AT to kill that BTR trying to wipe you out? The extra ammo won't help much if you're all dead. Just remember someone had to drive or fly all that ammo out there and try not to be overly wasteful. Next time you rearm, check the ammo point cost of each item. You can also select a specific kit to rearm rather than grabbing everything (click on the individual items).
- When topping off ammo at a FOB be mindful only to refill what you need. The ammo is being shared across all team members.
- Don't shoot from the HAB/rally. Don't draw attention to our spawn area. In fact, get away from the spawn area. Stop spending your entire game within 20m of the HAB.

[Back to top](#content)


## Do Never
- Dig down your own structures, unless specifically ordered to you are just trolling at this point
- Solo a vehicle, especially IFV (the tracked fighting vehicles) and Tanks
- Mine friendly traveled roads or friendly HABs. Put mines where enemies are going to drive, please.

## How To Make Friends in Squad
- Be a regular on a server and have a positive reputation.
- Play on the same server.
- Have an easy-to-pronounce and remember name.
- Answer questions teammates have.
- Talk to teammates, they don't even have to be in your squad. Make casual conversation (at appropriate times). Ask about the situation as you come upon teammates in the game. Make callouts of enemies you see. (it's amazing how many conversations I try to start up and the other person is mic-less, or so they seem to be, but 30 seconds later they finally start speaking. This is a huge turn-off. Talk in-game like you would IRL. Would you ignore that person standing next to you talking to you?)
- Know how to play Squad and play the objective. This leads to other regulars knowing they can depend on you.
- Rally the troops and pull random blueberries doing nothing into a useful task. Like when spawning on a FOB. Announce that our FOB 200m away is going down and everyone that can hear you should help push and save it.
- Play one step ahead of your SL so they don't have to ask for things.
- Have a good time and see the fun in losing at times.
- In short, build a positive reputation among the community you play with.
- This will take months/years to get to.
- You can find people you played Squad with in Steam -" Profile -" Friends -" Recently Played With -" Add your new friend!

# Game Mechanics

## What's this game about?
- Squad is a team game of communication, coordination, and movement.
- The goal of most of the game modes is to capture territory, not kill the enemy. Killing enemies is a secondary objective, often required to achieve the primary objective. Don't lose sight of the primary objective because you want to get a kill.
- The vast majority of this game is actually about NOT engaging the enemy, and then engaging them quickly and completely destroying them before they can respond. By not engaging the enemy, you and your team can move around them and secretly get into a position to destroy them.
- Rather get 0 kills and take out an enemy FOB to prevent them from spawning than get almost any number of kills. I call this "cutting the head off the snake" or "pulling them out by their roots". Go for the critical hit, not the "hits" they will simply recover from very easily.
- The secret to winning games is LOGISTICS. Meaning how fast can your team move around the map. This is done with FOB networks and vehicles and "spawn shifting" and smart rally placements. The game is not about outkilling your enemy, which may come naturally, but about outmaneuvering the enemy.
- Squad is a points game disguised as a tactical game. If you have a good sniper that can kill 30 players and AT that can kill 4 vehicles while holding a flag, you might just win. Points matter. Points are called Tickets in this game.

[Back to top](#content)


## Tickets
- To win a round, one of the teams must reduce the enemy's tickets to zero or have more tickets than the enemy by the end of the round (a round lasts up to 2 hours).
- Tickets are essentially the team's available "reinforcements" during the battle, as the number of tickets a team has denotes the number of times a team's players can collectively respawn. If a team's tickets are reduced to zero or are lower than the enemy's by the end of the round, they lose the match.
- Both teams are given a limited number of tickets.
- Certain events during a match will result in either team gaining or losing tickets. Below you can see the ticket change on your and the opponent's team for certain events.

| Your Team | Opposite Team | Event |
| --------: | ------------: | :---- | 
|         0 |             0 | Player goes into incapacitated state |
|        -1 |             0 | Player dies or gives up |
|        -2 |             0 | Commander dies or gives up |
|        60 |           -10 | Capture a Control Point in game mode X |

- Losing Vehicles - Ticket costs for your team
    - [- 5] Logi, Transport
    - [- 5] Light Attack and Recon Vehicles
    - [- 5] Anti-Air
    - [- 5] Helicopter
    - [-10] Armor Hunters, APC, IFV
    - [-15] Main Battle Tanks

- The highest ticket costs are game mode specific. Therefore, please check the ticket section for each game mode to get the full picture. Ticket values may change in future updates. For further information, [check out the Squad Wiki](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Game_Modes) or [Recent Squad Updates](https://joinsquad.com/updates/).

## Control Points
- Control Points (CP), also known as "flag" or "cap", are areas on the map that teams need to capture.
- A CP is a certain limited area of the battlefield, there is not an actual "flag" in the ground.
- The capping radius (or even shape) of a CP may differ for each CP on the map.
- CPs can be either neutral or belong to one of the teams.
- At least 3 players need to be within the capping radius of a CP to capture it. At the start of a round, a neutral CP can be capped by one player alone.
- It takes 2 minutes to capture a flag.
- If players from the opposite team are in the capping radius at the same time, players from the teams will cancel each other out. The team with more players in the radius will gradually take the CP.
- When you are inside the capping radius of a CP, the Control Point widget will appear. The flag shows who owns the CP and a progress bar shows the current progress of capping or decapping. The widget also shows the name of the CP.
    - Neutral CP show with a white bar,
    - those being capped or owned by your team show a blue bar.
    - A red bar indicates that the opposite team owns this CP (also indicated by the enemy's flag; e.g. Canadian flag).
- The layout of the CP on the map may change for the same map from game to game. In some game modes, CP can only be capped in a specific sequence (e.g. AAS, RAAS).

[Back to top](#content)


## Flags
- Main - The main base. This is where the game starts. Teams cannot capture the other team's main base. You cannot fire a weapon in the main base. You cannot fire into a base (it has an invisible shield that protects it). It is your team's safe harbor.
- Neutral flag - Flag that has not been captured yet by either side. For example, the very first flag once you leave main.
- Contested flag - Flag that has not been captured yet by either side and both teams are on the objective at the same time and try to capture it. The team with more people on the flag will capture it after 1-2 minutes. The middle flag often is contested by both teams at the same time.
- Middle flag - Exists only in map layers with an uneven number of objectives. It's the flag, well, in the middle. This is usually where both teams clash full force.
- Capped flag - A flag that has been successfully captured by a team.
- Offensive flag - This is the next flag that your team is going to capture. It has a red knife symbol on your map.
- Defensive flag - This is the flag your team already captured. You can see it being represented on the map by a blue shield symbol. You need to hold these flags. If you lose any defensive flags to the enemy, your team cannot capture additional flags. Should your team lose a defense flag, your team has to move back and recapture it. Sometimes squads are back capping, which means they are protecting the already captured flags from the enemy. Back capping only needs 1 person on the flag. However, if that one person is being killed by the enemy, you're losing this flag and your offensive cannot continue until you recapture this lost flag.

[Back to top](#content)


# Capping Mechanics
- The examples below are mostly for AAS/RAAS.
- To capture a point, players must stand within the point's capture area until it comes under their team's control.
- The cap rate doesn't change with more people on the flag. One person captures as fast as 10 from the same team.
- Once a flag is captured you can leave the area with all soldiers, but this is not advisable. Should an enemy squad stop by they can easily neutralize this flag. Therefore leave some soldiers behind (also called "back capping)". It's not the most exciting job to do, but it is important not to lose any already captured flags. Doing so will prevent your team from capturing any other flags until they recaptured the lost flag.
- Neutral flags can be capped by 1 person (e.g the first flag once you leave main).
- It takes 2 minutes to neutralize a flag that was previously captured by the enemy and then 2 more minutes to capture it.
- It takes the same amount of time to go from captured (capped) to neutral as it does to go from neutral to captured (capped).
- For flags that were captured by the enemy you'll need to have a minimum of 3 people and outnumber the enemy in the cap zone by 1 to neutralize it.
- On contested points (those caps not yet fully captured by either team) you have to outnumber the enemy contesting the point. So, if the enemy enters the cap zone of a neutral flag while you're capping it, you need at least one more person than them to continue capping.
- Any flag that's not a current objective for your team, you won't be able to capture. For example, you're not able to capture the flag after your current offensive flag. You first have to capture the offensive flag.
- Your team can only capture the next flag if they already captured the previous flags (those that connect back to your main base). And you have to keep holding these back caps.
- You need 3+ players to cap an active objective.
- On most maps, your defensive flag has a small and hard-to-see blue bar under it that indicates the level of cap that it has. You can view this on the map to see whether your defense is holding or whether the enemy has started to cap your defensive point and what % is capped already.
- Many people get confused by the indicator that shows up when you're inside a cap zone and capping the point. If the indicator bar is BLUE you are capping. The BLUE bar may be going down which indicates you are DEcapping what the enemy team has already capped. Many people panic and see the BLUE bar decreasing and think we are losing the cap, but that is not what is happening. If the BLUE bar goes white, no one is capping. If the BLUE bar goes RED, the enemy is capping. OWI needs to clarify this GUI element and make it more obvious as to what is happening.
- You can cap a neutral point with 1 person, assuming that point has not been previously captured.
- Capping any point that has previously been captured: you need at least 3 people in the cap zone, plus 1 more player than the enemy team has on that point.

[Back to top](#content)


## Ticket Bleed
- The enemy team will start bleeding tickets if you successfully capture at least one objective on the enemy side of the flag lattice. For each objective on the enemy part of the map, controlled by your team, the enemy will lose 1 ticket per minute.
- On map layers with an odd number of objectives, middle flags do not trigger ticket bleed. To introduce ticket bleed to the enemy, your team will need to capture at least one more flag past central. For example, if there are 5 objectives to capture in total, your team would need to capture 4 objectives to introduce ticket bleed to the enemy team.
- For map layers with an even number of objectives, your team will need to capture more than half of them to trigger ticket bleed on the enemy team. For example, if there are 6 objectives to capture in total, your team would need to capture 4 objectives to introduce ticket bleed to the enemy team.
- In the case of a "double-neutral" stalemate situation, all ticket bleed mechanics will be paused until the stalemate is resolved.
- If one team manages to successfully capture all flags on the map, the opposing team will suffer a catastrophic ticket bleed of 60 tickets per minute to bring about the end of the round more quickly. This is the equivalent of 60 soldiers being wiped out per minute.
- Ticket Bleed was removed from RAAS layers on all flags except when all flags have been captured (which still has -60 tickets per minute mercy bleed). This is intended to incentivize more dynamic movement along flag lattice, affording teams that have been pushed off a middle flag more time to stabilize, reconstitute and strategically plan a counterattack. [Source](https://joinsquad.com/2023/03/14/squad-update-v4-3-release-notes/)
- -10 ticket loss was removed when a flag is lost for the AAS, RAAS and Skirmish game modes. Currently, teams that lose a flag are already at a large detriment due to – having lost ground/key strategic land areas; likely having lost one or more FOBs in the area (each FOB is -20 tickets); likely have lost several infantry tickets (give ups); losses of any additional vehicles/logis (costing tickets) or disabled vehicles at the lost flag (which now cannot resupply or quickly rebuild FOBs). This change is intended to make losing flags less of a blow to the overall battle. [Source](https://joinsquad.com/2023/03/14/squad-update-v4-3-release-notes/)


[Back to top](#content)


## Double Neutral
- A double neutral occurs when the enemy neutralized your defensive flag and you neutralized their defensive flag. Now neither of you can finish your offensive capture until you have retaken your respective defensive flags.
- Double neutrals are possible in AAS and RAAS. If you neutralize the offensive flag and then lose your flag, the offensive flag will still be neutralized for the enemy, even if you can't see it on the map anymore. I've seen teams completely give up that advantage and leave the flag open for the enemy team to recapture because they don't understand that they're still holding it hostage.
- If the enemy team was starting to capture your neutralized flag before the double neutral was initiated, the defensive flag will continue to flash red, even though they're no longer able to manipulate the cap. Once a single friendly enters the cap range, the icon will stop flashing. This will be your guide for understanding when you've lost your hold on the enemy's flag. If that flag starts flashing red again, you've lost the double neutral and need to relocate.
- One thing to add. It's most confusing on RAAS because when the enemy neutralizes your defense flag and you neutralize theirs, you won't see the attack flag that you have neutralized. It is still there, and you are on the flag blocking it. There's just no indication. This always leads to squads leaving the flag they just neutralized since they think it's no longer active. It is just hidden. As an SL I always tell my guys that the flag is still here and we need to stay on it to keep the flag neutralized. Pretty much every single game the rest of the team will run back to the defense flag to try and get it back. The enemy will do the same, so you end up swapping back your flags and you're back to where you were at the start. TLDR; On RAAS the flag icon will disappear on a double neutral, it's still there and as long as you stay in the cap zone, you're still keeping the double neutral.
- To recap the double neutral flag you only need 3 friendlies in the flag, regardless of how many enemies there are.
- When you are attacking a point and it goes neutral, quickly check your map and look at the blue bar under your defensive flag. If there is no progression towards neutral, you won't go double neutral. If the enemy has started capping your defensive flag as you neutralize your offensive flag, you will go double neutral assuming no team stalls the cap of the other team
- Advice - Unless your situation is very stretched out and very likely to fall apart, focus your team on holding the double neutral while sending one squad to recap the neutral flag. They don't need to win firefights, only be sneaky, get in cap and stay alive. The rest of the team should focus on holding a secure perimeter around the offensive point. A common mistake teams make is everyone falls back from a double neutral, making it an easy recap and cap on the next point as an entire team moves between points.

# Game Modes
- Squad can be played in different game modes.
- Servers will rotate maps, and sometimes game modes, after every match.
- The most common game modes are Advance and Secure, Random Advance and Secure, Skirmish, and Invasion.
- Games can last up to 2 hours.
- The team with 0 tickets or the least amount of tickets at the end of the game will lose.
- Please note that game mode rules can change and changes may not be reflected in this guide by the time of the update.

[Back to top](#content)


## (Random) Advance and Secure
- AAS/RAAS are control point modes. These modes are played on most servers.
- The objective for both teams is to capture and hold Control Points (aka flags) in a preset order (or in a random order in RAAS). Capturing enemy flags penalizes the enemy team and rewards you with additional Tickets. The team that first runs out of tickets will lose.
- AAS moves you along predetermined points that you can see at the start of a match, capture them. Stand near a location to capture it. You can see the progress bar at the top of the screen.
- Two teams will start from opposite ends of the map in their main base, or in certain circumstances a limited forward spawn area. The team's objective is to capture and hold Control Points from the enemy team. Control Points can only be captured in a specific order that will appear on the map
- Your team cannot capture a Control Point out of order, your team will need to capture and hold the previous flag. This is indicated by the Attack and Defense markers that appear over Control Points on your map (these markers look like a knife, respectively a shield on your map). - If both teams neutralize two opposing flags in the CP's line of sequence, it's a stalemate - neither team can take their next attack flag. - Only after a neutralized defense flag has been re-captured, the next attack flag can be captured.
- As each team starts to cap neutral flags, it's not possible for enemies to block this capping process. For example: if one soldier is in the capture zone of their team's first flag and nine enemies are in that cap zone as well trying to block it, the flag will still be captured. Once they find him and kill him, the flag will (obviously) stop capping. This should severely reduce the "Rush Flags" meta, and shift the focus more towards the linear progression of moving from flag area to flag area, as well as having a proper supply train with FOBs and logistics. Blocking a flag is technically still possible if you eliminate the entire attacking force, but it will require more resources to do and is more likely to fail.
- The team who runs out of tickets first loses. Therefore assets and FOBs play a big role in the ticket count of a team as well. Knowledge about the value of those assets can help you in correctly analyzing the situation of a team. Securing a flag while losing a lot of assets can harm your team's effort in winning a round.
- Furthermore, keep in mind that individual scores do not affect the result of the match.
- Gaining Tickets:
    - [+20] for capturing neutral flags that have not been capped previously.
    - [+50] for capturing flags that belong to the enemy.
- Losing Tickets:
    - [-20] when the enemy captures flags that belong to you.
    - [-10] for losing a Forward Operating Base (FOB; "Radio").
    - [- 1] by Infantry lost (bleed out).
    - [- 5] by Light Vehicles, Transports or Logistics lost.
    - [-10] by Armored Personnel Carriers (APC) or Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) lost.
    - [-15] by Main Battle Tank lost.
- Ticket Bleed AAS/RAAS
    - The enemy team will start bleeding tickets if you successfully capture at least one objective on the enemy side of the flag lattice. For each objective on the enemy part of the map, controlled by your team, the enemy will lose 1 ticket per minute.
    - On map layers with an odd number of objectives, central objectives are considered a middle ground, and therefore do not trigger ticket bleed, to avoid causing King of the Hill fights for it. On such layers, your team will need to capture at least one more flag past central, for the enemy to start bleeding tickets.
    - For map layers with an even number of objectives, your team will need to capture more than half of them to trigger ticket bleed on the enemy team.
    - In the case of a "double-neutral" stalemate situation, all ticket bleed mechanics will be paused until the stalemate is resolved.
    - Once your team captures all Control Points of the map, the enemy team will begin to Mercy Bleed. It's a fixed value of 60 Tickets over 60 seconds (the tickets tick down continuously every second). Mercy Bleed will stop if the enemy team manages to capture back the last Control Points.
- Example:
- Let's say there are 5 flags on the map (this doesn't include main bases, those aren't really flags).
- If each team holds 2 flags, and the middle flag is neutral (white), nothing happens.
- If one team captures the middle flag and now holds 3 flags to the other team's 2 flags. That will incur a penalty of 1 ticket loss every 30 seconds to the enemy team that holds fewer flags.
- If you've got 6 flags in your match, and you hold 4 flags to their 2 then it doubles: now you make them bleed 2x tickets every 30 seconds (or about 1 every 15 seconds).
- Every additional flag you own more than them, the bleed stacks.
- So in a 6 flag match if you own all 6 flags and they own 0 the bleed is pretty intense. Matches end in only a few minutes.
- Just keep in mind that a ticket loss every 15 seconds means the equivalent of losing a 9-person squad every 2 minutes 15 seconds. That's a squad spawning in and getting killed right away. If you only had 1 flag over them, it's 1 ticket every 30 seconds which is like a whole squad being wiped every 5 minutes. If you visualize ticket losses like that, you can understand why holding flags is so important. In addition to the bleed, capturing a point from the enemy gives you instantly 50 tickets and the enemy loses 20 tickets.
- RAAS - Even though the next objective seems to show up randomly, [Squadlanes.com](https://squadlanes.com) can help to predict the next possible objective(s).

## Invasion
- Invasion - one team attacks and the other defends, attackers need to capture quickly or they lose.
- One Team has all flags from the start and a huge number of tickets. The other team is the attacker. They only have 200 tickets, but usually a major advantage due to having more vehicles. The attacking team gets 100 tickets per captured flag. Once the attacking team has captured a flag, it cannot be retaken by the defenders.
- Defending team wins if the attacking team has 0 tickets left. The attacking team wins when they capture all flags or the defending team has 0 tickets left. This mode has a very well-defined front line as everyone is fighting for one flag.
- Might also be good for a first game although the beginning of the round is very hectic for the defenders and usually attackers have a hard time in this mode.
- The Mutaha Invasion v1 layer is the only game that plays during the night.

## Skirmish
- Like AAS but on a smaller map with fewer players. Sounds good to train, but gives the wrong impression about scale, distances, vehicles, etc. in the game. Would not recommend playing this game mode first as a new player.
- Starting tickets are much lower than AAS and RAAS, generally, 100 tickets for each team. When a control point is first captured, that team gains 10 tickets instead of the 20 found in AAS. When a team captures an enemy control point, the ticket gain/loss is +20 / -20 instead of 30. This is due to the reduced number of tickets each team begins with. When a team reaches 0 tickets, that team loses the match.
- Skirmish layers are useful for seeding servers or low population gameplay due to their small size. Engagements are much more frequent and matches end quicker.

## Territory Control (TC)
- Territory Control (TC) consists of a grid of Hexes (hexagons), which function like capture zones.
- The goal of the game mode is to either (A) have the other team run out of tickets or (B) capture 95% of all hexes. As ticket counts are generally high in this game mode, games tend to be very long and drawn out. 
- It requires 1 person to capture an initially neutral zone.
- It requires 3 people to capture an enemy zone. This is also true for hexes that were previously captured and then neutralized.
- If the enemy tries to cap the hex at the same time as you, your team needs one more person than the enemy within the control point to cap it.
- On initial spawn, a few of these hexes will already be captured for both sides and will be connected to neutral hexes which only require one player to capture. Capturable hexes will be slightly less opaque and have a blue border with a friendly owned hex. Enemy hexes will also show this border and less opaqueness but instead are tinted red.
- The Anchor Hex is the starting point of the team's capture chain. This hex has an anchor icon on it. Other hexes must be connected to the Anchor Hex to not be cut off. Capturing the enemies Anchor Hex will prevent the enemy team from taking new territory and contesting any hex. 
- Enemy hexes take 40 seconds to neutralize, and neutral hexes take 45 seconds to capture.
- Capturing a hex unlocks all adjacent (bordering) hex zones for capture.
- Bleed: 
	- For every two hex zones captured beyond owning 60% of all hexes, the enemy will start bleeding 1 ticket per minute with a maximum of 5-6 tickets per minute (team must cap 10+ hexes or beyond 60% of all hexes). 
	- Once a team captures "= 95% of all tiles, ticket bleed will increase to ~120 tickets per minute (has to be confirmed in-game or by OWI).
	- Example: Al Basrah has 20 hexes in total. 60% = 12 hexes, 95% = 19 hexes.
- Hex capture status is invisible until you capture an adjacent hex zone (fog of war).
- Each team has a 'key territory' hex marked with a shield, at the base of their grid.
- If any (group of) hexes owned by your team gets disconnected from that key territory (because the enemy captures hexes in between), you will not be able to attack bordering hexes from them until their connection to your key territory is restored.
- If the enemy captures your key territory hex, all your remaining hexes lose their connection to the key territory, so you'll need to recapture your key territory hex to continue capturing enemy territory.
- When your team captures 95% of all hexes, your team instantly wins.
- Focus on enemy spawn points and not the hexes themselves. Cutting off spawn-points makes it easier to take hexes.

# Infantry
- Infantry is an army specialization whose personnel engage in military combat on foot, distinguished from artillery and armored forces.
- Also known as foot soldiers or infantrymen, infantry traditionally rely on traveling by foot between combats as well, but may also use military vehicles (motorized, and mechanized infantry) or aircraft (airborne infantry) for between-combat mobility and logistics. 
- Infantry makes up a large portion of all armed forces in most nations, and typically bears the largest brunt in warfare, as measured by casualties, discomfort, fatigue, and both physical and psychological stress.

## Rifleman
- Use the Rifleman kit if you're new to the game. It's a great way to learn the basics.
- Choose the basic Rifleman role WITH OPTIC and run that for a long time until you get a better sense of the game.
- You have an ammo bag (your backpack) that you can put down. Your team can refill their supplies with it. Very important for LAT, HAT, and Medic. Ask them if they need to refill medkits/ammo. Your SL may put you in a fireteam with HAT/LAT.
- Always keep your gun on semi-auto. Full auto may only make sense in CQB.
- Communicate things that you see to your squad.
- Move slower than you think you need to. Whenever I rush or think I'm too safe I get killed. That also has to be balanced, going too slow won’t get anything done.
- Once you have experience as a Rifleman check out Medic/Automatic Rifleman. Automatic Rifleman is all about positioning and suppression. Medic is self-explanatory.
- Most of all, don’t be afraid to fail. Try new kits or roles and accept that you’re probably going to be shit the first few times. Youtube tutorials are a godsend for the more advanced kits like AT or armor.

## Medic
- Communicate - Secure - Rescue
- The Real MVP - As a Medic alongside the Squad Leader you form the backbone of your squad. The SL gets the show on the road but the Medics are the true MVPs who keep it going. I want you Medics to recognize your value and learn to say "No." You don't need to revive everyone always and you definitely should not put yourself at such a risk where the most likely outcome is that you end up dead on top of your buddy. Your survival should be a priority for everyone in the squad and if you think it's too high of a risk to revive someone in the middle of the road, you should have the balls to say "no, I won't" and that's fine. ‘You should never end up in a situation where you die with a bandage in your hand, that means either you've misassessed the situation or someone who was supposed to cover you messed up.
- Basic Gameplay - Basic play as a Medic is pretty straightforward, you bandage bleeding or incapacitated friendlies and bring them back to full health with the medpack (or the Force). On top of that, you're expected to be the last man standing in most cases to get the most out of your ability to revive others. Few tips to help you achieve this are to stay in the middle or back part of your squad to not catch the first bullet that comes your way. You're better off letting someone else catch it and go pick them up when the coast is clear. You also want to stay separate from the other Medic in the squad so that you don’t both get killed in the same instance or by the same enemy. This often prevents the squad from being wiped too quickly. It's common practice to have one Medic stay close to SL and the other with the rest of the squad to keep a simple separation between the two. Revive priority is SL + Medic " AT " Joe
- Communication & How to be an asset to your squad
    - The easiest thing to do to go from "Yeah, it's some dude playing a Medic" to "Holy shit that guy is super useful how do we recruit him now and have babies in the progress" is 100% communication as you can both relay critical information that nobody else has and talking to the people you're trying to rescue ups their chances of survival quite significantly. Firstly you've got the Medic Vision which allows you to see downed players in about a 150m radius around you regardless if they're in your squad or not. This gives you the best overall picture of how the fight is going and learning to relay the crucial information from this to your squad members and Squad Leader can change the pace of the fight and save you from getting flanked or losing assets.
    - Secondly, you should be in constant communication with your squad members and the other Medic to get your reviving responsibilities handled effectively and safely. As a Medic, you have a certain amount of authority, and asking/telling the other individual to cover you should be a routine aspect of your game. When reviving players they should preemptively tell you critical information about their status like "An enemy is standing on top of me" or "I got sniped from West but am in good cover so clear to pick up". Good players do this, but more often than not you need to demand it if you're unsure of what you're getting into. Again, your survival is more critical than the random Joe's in the middle of the street there. Once you are reviving them, if the situation demands it, tell them what to do as they get up to survive the next 3 seconds as well. Nothing is more frustrating than busting your ass saving a guy and having them stand up and get shot in the face the moment they're back in the game. So tell them not to.
- You have a rifle - Use it - As a last gameplay tip, do remember that while you usually play the friendly neighborhood doc, you're still kitted out to kill, even better than a normal leman. You've got the same kit with extra bandages and the ability to heal yourself fully in between taking hits. You're literally the Terminator in the right circumstances. Use this to your advantage and if there is no one else to clear the enemies for you, go do it yourself. You're always better off dying in a 1v1 fight that - while won - allows you to revive a friendly than walking straight up to the friendly and getting killed on top of them because the enemy was still watching his body.
- Common phrases for a Medic:
    - "Don’t look at me - look at the enemy"
    - "Where did you get shot from"
    - "Are you safe to pick up?"
    - "X, cover me, I'll get Z up"
    - "I can't (won't) get you X, give up"
    - "No, you're in a shit spot, give up"
    - "X coming up, stay down!
    - "X coming up, cover the door"
    - "Medic low/out of bandages"
    - "Hey, other Medic, I'll get X, you get Z"
    - "I'm coming to get you X, don’t give up"
    - "Good job X, you gave up just as I was getting you up. Idiot."
- Using Medic Vision to aid squad members and relay information to Squad Leader
    - "Everyone in the HAB in F2 is dying"
    - "Everyone in the west building in the cap zone is dead"
    - "Squad 2 just West of us is getting wiped"
    - "Hey X, the blueberry in front of you just died"
    - "Most of the squad is down, give us a moment SL"
    - "Both Medics down, everyone give up"
    - "All friendlies died in the cap we just left"
    - "No friendlies alive in the cap, grenades free"
    - "Some friendlies are dying behind us, we might be getting flanked"
- Common mistakes for a Medic:
    - Double Medic is the behavior where 2 Medics go revive/heal the same person. Don't do it. Just don't. It is a significant risk of losing both friendly Medics at literally no reward to be gained by doing it. It's a senseless risk you don't need to ever take. Stop it.
    - Smoking on top of the player you're trying to save. AKA "shoot here - marker" - In most cases, you want to throw the smokes in between the player you're trying to revive and the enemies shooting at him or watching his body. This way the smokes block the enemy line of sight more than they blind you and you might just survive in there. Throwing it on top of the guy you're trying to save lets the enemy keep a better overview of the situation and you're making the downed player and yourself a bullet/RPG magnet. It has a time and a place.
    - I'm a Medic so I must medic - mentality. This is when you tunnel vision on nothing but reviving people and run around like with your bandages or medkit in hand in the middle of combat. Or running to revive a player who is downed only a second ago. What do you think happened to the enemy who killed him? Fall asleep? No. Don't end up dead on top of your buddy. You have a rifle - Use it.
- You need to stick with your squad.
- Be aware of your surroundings, make sure you know where the enemy is so you don't get killed trying to revive a teammate.
- Prioritize! Revive other fellow Medics first, if there are multiple people down, bandage them all at the same time so they don't bleed out.
- Your safety before others. This means you need to make sure you're not under any fire or threat. Make sure you are safe! No point in trying to revive someone when you're taking MG fire in your direction.
- Communicate! Use your local voice channel to tell those who are down to keep breathing and not go towards the bright light.
- Medics are important to ensure a victory for your team, as I've had many close games where we end up winning with less than 20 tickets.
- You have a shovel and can build structures too. Though this shouldn't be your primary objective when your teammates are down.
- Ask if they know where the shot came from and how much time they have left.
- Don't smoke your position, always smoke as far away from yourself as you can, in the enemy’s direction.
- While bandaging, freelook in that direction and if you see movement, abandon the bandage, swap to rifle, and shoot.
- Bandages heal bleeds (blood droplet symbol).
- Kit heals health.
- Have to fix the bleed first then heal.
- Right-click with kit heals yourself, left-click heals friendlies.
- Second Medic kit has a long-range optic.
- Try to always have a visual on your Squad Leader. If they go down before they can place a rally or FOB your whole squad will most likely lose the precious ground they just covered.
- If you go down, the squad goes down.
- In a firefight with multiple downed friendlies, when reviving, give each person a quick tap with the Medic bag (don't fully heal them). This quick tap allows your friend to begin building stamina, and therefore allows them to aim better and help defend while you go and get to another person. Go back when it's clear/everyone is up and then begin fully healing them.

## Automatic Rifleman
- Your main job is to suppress the enemy.
- The purpose of suppression is to allow your squadmates to maneuver.
- Go prone, increase accuracy, reduce recoil.
- Short bursts, 3-5 rounds, don't just suppress for the sake of suppression.
- Smart positioning and movement, don't silhouette yourself, cover chokepoints, reduce exposure, move often.
- Stay in the rear of the formation, will be easier to provide cover when friendlies move forward
- Suppressing fire will absolutely force people into cover, but it typically has to be focused on 1-2 discrete positions, you can't just spray back and forth across an entire area. This typically means you can't suppress an entire squad.
- If you engage enemies, lay down, get your bipod out and lay down rounds on full auto. You get a massive boost to recoil control while prone with any bipodded weapon.
- Shoot and scoot. When you shoot any enemies in the area will be able to see where you are firing from. So move after firing! Reposition yourself and lay down some more fire! That technique is best used in open areas that are non-urban. So move yourself depending on the situation and where you are relative to the hostile position. In urban areas just cover an area while prone if possible and kill anything that moves in sight, just be sure that the only place you can get shot from is also a place where you can shoot at.
- I find the SAW is much better in wide-open terrain or urban settings where you can place yourself more deliberately relative to the enemy. In forests and hedgerows, where the enemy can appear from any direction, the lack of subtlety is more of a liability, and the raw firepower is less of an advantage.
- Your tracers will make you an irresistible target for everyone who sees them. Move often or have a well-hidden position.

## Grenadier
- Use your sighting range with X and send long-range nades
- Your smokes are amazing for pushing or covering movement
- Your main challenge will be estimating ranges and adjusting your GL launcher accordingly. This is probably 50% of the skill. It'll come with practice. Probably most helpful will be getting used to how big a typical soldier silhouette looks at different ranges for common reference points. When firing at longer ranges, opening the map and counting the grids (and estimations for diagonals). Ranging will be important when trying to squeeze those GLs into doorways and windows.
- GLs should mainly be used against concentrated enemies but this will rarely happen if you're going against an experienced team that knows their spacing. However, people still have to spawn at a HAB and this could be your moment to shine.
- Another part of your skill and survival will be managing when to switch to GL and when to switch to your scoped rifle. You can often get caught out by the enemy with your GL out and not enough time to switch back. This is when n00b-tubing comes in handy - quickly snapping onto the enemy and GL-ing right under his feet, praying he's far enough for GL to arm.
- Throw smokes not exactly on top of enemies but fairly close in front of them. It's useful to smoke up stationary MGs, etc since riflemen will just reposition and the smoke plume is pretty thin. Remember that sometimes it may be more beneficial not to smoke up an enemy, e.g. if you have a vehicle supporting from behind just waiting for the dude to peek and take him out.
- Do smoke up enemy MGs and vics, forcing them to reposition, especially if they are sitting at a very good camping spot and causing trouble to defenders.
- Bear in mind that you may run into SLs wanting an extra Rifleman rather than GL (for that extra resupply for his LATs) so you may not always have the opportunity to practice.
- Player movement is damn quick, so not only will you need to be calculating distance, but you also need to account for your target’s movement, and at range, this can be very difficult against a target sprinting full-bore. Splash damage is weak enough that if you are even a hair too short or too behind, your target will just keep running. At range, it is often better to take 10 potshots and miss 9 of them than it is to launch one 40mm.
- It is also a very map-situational kit. On maps where with lots of elevation differences like Fools Road Grenadier is often not as good as regular old bullets.
- Marking smoke can really shine on urban maps, though. On Narva or Basrah it can be hard to make accurate callouts that distinguish between different buildings. See half a squad run into a building? Stick a red smoke to the balcony and holler in local chat, "enemy in red smoke building!"
- If you want to get more accurate with the GL, I'd avoid changing the sight zero and just wing it. Load up the firing range and just sit there for an hour shooting grenades at shit.
- The HE grenades are great to put into compounds, buildings or tree lines that you know contain enemies but are not visible. It's basically for area denial as opposed to shooting at singular targets.
- Grenades will not arm if you hit targets that are too close (less than 50m).
- Smokes should be placed in the sightline between the location you desire to reach and the enemy when assaulting. Smoke close to the enemy can also force them to relocate. They are very useful to mask compromised positions when defending to allow them to keep firing or reposition despite being bracketed. It's a marker though and should only be used when your cover is blown/you're ok with blowing your cover. This will become even more true once the helis are in the sky looking for it.
- GL smoke is for marking, not concealment. For example, there's a sniper in a bush up on a hillside. You have one of your smokes land next to the sniper and a bright blue plume of smoke will appear and they will be forced to retreat since their position is no longer hidden.

## HAT and LAT

- In Squad two infantry roles carry anti-tank weapons.
- The Light anti-tank also called LAT has access to a heat projectile rocket launcher with medium damage and is considered a defensive role in a squad to disable or mobility kill vehicles. The maximum number of LATs in a squad is 2.
- The Heavy Anti-Tank role also called HAT is limited to two players for the whole team and is a far more offensive role that can outright destroy light vehicles and cause great damage to heavily armored vehicles.
- Both roles are crucial for the team to succeed, they can protect your squad from deadly vehicles and inflict heavy ticket losses on the enemy. Oftentimes a Squad Leader calls for an AT to be in the squad and for a 9-man squad it is frequently happening that both LAT roles must be taken at the beginning of the round. With the HAT role, you are taking even more responsibility for your team and it is expected from you that you know what you are doing.
- Fire all LAT and HAT on Jensen's Range and learn the sight markings. They are different for each type of launcher.
- Learn what you can damage and where the damage will work.
- Rockets have an arming distance. Don't be too close to the target.
- The scroll wheel is critical for quickly selecting the proper RPG warhead. If you use the number keys, which many people do, the frag rocket is selected by default which can waste valuable time.
- Also at round start, if the Squad Leader has asked you to spawn, it's often a good idea to get into the vehicle with your heat warheads equipped, because you might run right into an enemy vehicle. The best way to do this is to sprint straight to the vehicle and select the heat rocket right before getting in, this will let you skip the lengthy animation, so your squad doesn't have to wait or leave without you.
- A loaded logi is your high-value target. Here's a simple way to Identify a logistics truck, if you see barrels and some boxed stuff in the back, it's definitely a logi truck. You can prevent your enemy from building or supplying a FOB.
- Take a look at the vehicle models in Jensen's Range. Armors with different thicknesses are colorized on every vehicle. As you could see, frontal and turret armor are always the thickest, side armor will be thinner, and rear armor will be the thinnest one. To maximize the efficiency of Anti-Tank rockets, it's always best to aim for the weakest part.
- Check the map for enemy vehicle positions.
- Clear your back since all of the launchers have backblast and can severely injure or kill your teammates.
- Always reset your zeroing after you have shot your rockets, if not this can lead to awkward situations where you overshoot way too far above your targets
- Run around vehicles if you are close to an immobilized vehicle if you have no ammo left, to distract them from other ATs, Some Turrets turn very slow and can be easily outrun
- Crewman’s that are trying to repair the vehicle are always exiting behind the vehicle or in case of tanks on top
- If Crewmen are repairing the vehicle in cover out of your line of sight use a grenade to injure or kill them or fire a fragmentation rocket at the ground close to the vehicle the large splash damage area will kill everything behind the vehicle

### HAT Tactics
- The Heavy Anti-Tank is the most effective anti-vehicle role in Squad, equipped with the most powerful and greatest number of rockets. Given the kit's greater firepower compared with LAT, each team is limited to just two Heavy Anti-Tank kits. The primary Heavy Anti-Tank kit is unlocked when a team reaches 15 players and the secondary kit is unlocked when a team reaches 20 players. Each squad requires a minimum of three players to claim each kit. One squad can claim both kits, although allowing two squads to claim a kit is generally preferred. The HAT role falls under the Specialist role type, which is limited to two per team.
- Rockets specific to the HAT role include the M3 MAAWS 84mm Tandem rocket and 84mm High Explosive Anti-Tank rocket, (US Army), RPG-7 40mm RPG-7V2 Tandem Heavy Anti-Tank rocket (Russian Ground Forces, Irregular Militia, and Insurgents), and RPG-29 105mm Tandem Heavy Anti-Tank round (Irregular Militia, Insurgents).
- The minimum arming distance of HAT rockets is 40 meters. This means your target must be further away or your rocket won’t explode. Heavy Anti-Tank players need to be able to visually know how far the arming distance is in-game to not waste a rocket by firing on an enemy vehicle that is too close. The RPG-29 has a greater arming distance, closer to 25 meters.
- When playing as HAT, you must know where enemy vehicles are on the map. Players in a squad and Squad Leaders themselves need to communicate with one another regarding the location of enemy vehicles, particularly Main Battle Tanks. Enemy vehicle markers should be placed by Squad Leaders whenever possible and deleted when unnecessary.
- HAT is one of the most valuable roles on the battlefield given its ability to destroy heavy enemy armor. The most important skills a Heavy Anti-Tank player can acquire is proper ranging and use of the Russian PGO-7 2.8x optic. Practice on Jensen's Range before playing on a server. Similarly, the same can be done with the M3 MAAWS of the US Army, with the only difference being that the sights can be adjusted to fit the target range, and the range markers on the sight change depending on the type of round that is loaded. Please refer to the RPG-7 page for information on how to properly range targets using the PGO-7 2.8x reticle, and the M3 MAAWS page.
- When possible, have a Rifleman remain close to the Heavy Anti-Tank, especially if heavy armor such as a Main Battle Tank is nearby. This will allow the Heavy Anti-Tank player to quickly reload using the Rifleman's ammo bag to fire another rocket if necessary.
- The Heavy Anti-Tank is often abbreviated as HAT.
- Helicopters may be hit mid-air with practice. For a 100m target flying straight at normal speed, you must aim 2-3 helicopter lengths ahead. Helicopters may seem closer than they actually are.
- Most HAT kits have both a stronger and a weaker rocket. If possible, fire a ranging shot with the weaker rocket first, aiming to disable tracks or wheels. Hold the rocket launcher still after firing, and observe which range mark the rocket lands on. This can be used to quickly and accurately calculate distance. Follow up with the stronger rocket.

[Back to top](#content)


### LAT Tactics
- Although LAT is not as powerful as HAT in terms of anti-vehicle capabilities, it is still a crucial role. LAT is a much less restricted kit, offering eight total slots per team compared with just two Heavy Anti-Tank kits. Also, more LAT kits come with a rifle equipped with an optic, making them more effective at long-range engagements as a Rifleman.
- Each faction offers two types of LAT kits; a primary and a secondary. Every squad is limited to one primary and one secondary kit, unlocked when a squad reaches three and six players respectively. Teams are restricted to four primary kits and four secondary kits total, unlocked when the team reaches six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four players total respectively. The Light Anti-Kit kit is considered a Fire Support role, which is restricted to three per squad.
- The rockets used by LAT are the M72 LAW (US Army and British Army) 66 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank rocket, the RPG-26 (Russian Ground Forces) 83 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank rocket, and the RPG-7 (Russian Ground Forces, Irregular Militia, Insurgents) OG-7V Fragmentation rocket and PG-7V High Explosive Anti-Tank rocket. Please visit a faction's respective Wiki page for more information on specific kit load-outs. These rockets all deal High Explosive Anti-Tank type damage, whereas the rockets exclusive due to the Heavy Anti-Tank deal Heavy Anti-Tank type damage, which is calculated differently based on a vehicle's type and armor.
- Given the increase in the number of Vehicles in Squad, including Main Battle Tanks, the ability to destroy or disable enemy vehicles is increasingly vital to the success of a team. On Maps (layers) with a large number of vehicles, as many LAT kits as possible should be claimed. A team that is not able to effectively deal with enemy vehicles often loses a match, given vehicles’ ability to ferry troops across the map, supply Forward Operating Bases, and provide massive fire support on the battlefield.
- LATs should stick close to one another to provide sustained fire against vehicles since many vehicles require multiple hits from their rockets to be destroyed.
- Before firing a rocket, make sure none of your allies are behind you to avoid damage from the back-blast. In general, players warn others in local chat by saying something like, "About to fire, clear back-blast!" before firing.
- Although LAT is not as capable of destroying vehicles as HAT, LAT rockets cost half as much to resupply as the rockets exclusive to the Heavy Anti-Tank. So although LAT rockets do less damage, they are less expensive to rearm at an ammo bag or ammo crate. See Ammo Crate for a full list of resupply costs.
- With the introduction of persistent ammo, players who spawn at a Forward Operating Base or Rally point will not spawn with any spent rockets. They will need to seek out an Ammo Crate, Vehicles with ammo points, or a Rifleman's Ammo Bag to resupply. Switching to a LAT kit also means you will also spawn with no rockets unless you spawn at Main Base.
- LATs are most effective when used to disable tracks/wheels, allowing follow-up shots from fellow ATs or vehicles. Crewmen will be forced to disembark to repair the vehicle, and may then be engaged.

### Engaging The Enemy With AT
- Always have cover - Try to get near a wall, a bush, or inside a building, it is important for your success as an AT to survive the initial attack, and reload out of cover or get ammunition. Vehicles have a limited field of view and oftentimes a slow turning rate of their turrets, abuse that by hiding behind cover after you've shot your rocket. Gunners will have a hard time locating you if the distance is below 100m. But be wary of windows or trenches that can lead to death if a vehicle fires high explosive rounds at you. I recommend immediately falling back if you have successfully hit your target to reload. If possible, run back to an ammo crate or a Rifleman to resupply, avoid running over open terrain, and if it's not possible to get to one just wait. Armored vehicles will often keep moving to avoid further hits from ATs. You can also use a nearby MRAP, or BMP nearby to resupply your Rockets. All vehicles except the Tank will always carry enough ammo to resupply you. It's also common for Insurgent and Militia Heavy ATs to park a bike or a technical nearby to resupply, as they consume a lot of ammo.
- Don't be too close - All Rockets have an arming distance, which means they can only explode after they have traveled a certain distance. For all HEAT rockets, the distance is 25 meters, for all heavy tandem rockets, it's 40m. If the vehicle is too close to have, take distance or let it pass by you and then take the shot. Sometimes vehicles will try to use that to their advantage and will drive close to you so you can’t arm your rocket, oftentimes this results in the vehicle not being able to kill you because the turret can't reach that far down. The key to that problem is patience. Don't panic. If you have a launcher that doesn't take long to prepare like the law or the RPG-26, just take out your rifle and wait for a mistake by the driver then reposition. And get your launcher back out.
- Don't give up - Oftentimes it is tempting to just respawn after you missed your shot and died to a 30 Mill, just to resupply your missile. Don’t. If you do that ten times over and over it was not worth ticket-wise to destroy that 30-mil BTR. You are still infantry whose main goal is to capture objectives and kill enemies. Wait for the Medic and continue fighting infantry instead of suiciding to get that one kill on the vehicle. Be patient and wait for mistakes of the vehicle crew like pushing your spawn HAB or staying in an area where they have no infantry support.
- Mobility kills are important - Most of the time as an AT you will not have the opportunity to destroy a vehicle in two shots, you either have to do low damage as a LAT or you will not get the chance to shoot twice since the vehicle has already escaped. To mobility kill a vehicle you have to damage certain parts of it to stop it from fleeing. A rule of thumb is that aiming for certain parts of the vehicle is only important if you are below the 100m distance. Beyond that distance, you will have trouble hitting targeted compartments, and probably miss moving vehicles. Just get close to the vehicle or don't even try to get a mobility kill, it is more important to do damage instead of missing completely.
    But if you are getting a close shot onto a vehicle that is moving slowly or static, aim for important compartments.
Vehicles with tracks like a tank, IFVs, or the MTL-B and the Bulldog can be brought to an immediate halt by destroying their tracks.
Every rocket is capable of damaging and destroying tracks of any vehicle, which makes mobility kills very easy.
The Crewmen have to exit their vehicle and repair the tracks from the outside to get the vehicle moving again. During this time, they are sitting ducks for any enemy vehicle or to more ATs that are then focused on damaging the vehicle. Oftentimes ATs will even push around the vehicle to kill the guy trying to repair it.
    If they are killed the armor is almost always lost. If no one comes to rescue them the gunner is either trapped in one position and forced to endure further attacks of rockets or they also try to get out and risk losing the vehicle altogether if they get killed.
Always destroy the tracks of the vehicle first. I even recommend for the Russian ATs to first use their normal heat rocket to track the enemy and then use their slow-flying tandem on a static target to get a better chance of hitting it.
    If you encounter vehicles with normal wheels like a Stryker or a BTR you can try to aim for their engine to make significantly slow down. A vehicle with a damaged engine can't accelerate anymore and also needs to be repaired from the outside.
To hit the engine is far harder to hit and can be missed pretty easily. If the vehicle is moving too fast to be hit precisely in the engine, I would consider not aiming for the engine but center mass. For MATVs and Scout cars it is not so important where you hit them because they get to a burning state in just two rocket hits. Lighter vehicles than these can be very easily destroyed by mass center hits.
    There is another option to hinder the capabilities of a vehicle by damaging their turret to a point where they can't properly turn it to engage targets. The most effective vehicle is the Crows system family, like the Stryker or the MATV-Crows. If the rocket hits right on the turret it will destroy the turret completely and render the vehicle useless. However, the vehicle will receive no damage and can safely return to base to repair. This strategy can be used for situations where the vehicle's body is behind hardcover or you have no prospect of getting any more ammunition to destroy the vehicle.

## Marksman
- The primary objective of the Marksman is to provide long-range combat support for the squad. The secondary objective of the Marksman is to conduct scouting operations in tactical vantage points against the enemy. This role is equipped with a rifle featuring a high-powered optic for long-range engagements, a sidearm for emergencies, two field dressings for wounds, grenades (two variants), a shovel for construction of deployables, and a pair of binoculars for scouting and ranging targets. This role is strongly recommended to be used in large, open maps with little cover or urban maps with tall buildings. It is strongly discouraged to use the Marksman in close-quarters combat. If used correctly, the Marksman can be the most lethal member of the squad and can inflict heavy casualties on the enemy when least expected. Resupply costs 50 ammo points.
- Stay near your teammates.
- Great for watching no man's land, like highways that infantry needs to cross.
- Surprise attacks are a must when using this role, use the opportunity to your advantage at all times.
- Using cover while on the move is also very important. Without it, you will be spotted and eliminated.
- Shoot and scout tactics should be taken into consideration. Staying in one spot during an engagement for too long will eventually lead to your death.
- Always make sure you have a safe spot to retreat to in case your engagement backfires.
- Be sure to keep a close eye on your ammunition, you do not want to be engaging the enemy on an empty magazine.
- Always be sure to stay close to your squad, fighting alone will guarantee no victory against a force larger than you.
- Make sure you always have the high ground, this will secure a better chance of victory in any engagement.
- Keeping clear communication between you and your Squad Leader is very important and will prove very helpful.
- Do not bite more than you can chew, think twice before you make a move against the enemy.
- You are the eyes and ears of your squad (and possibly others), your awareness as a Marksman is crucial to the survival of your teammates.

## Combat Engineer and Sapper
- This is one of the only classes where you are allowed to roam.
- You should be hunting FOBs or laying mines.
- Place explosive devices to destroy enemy FOBs or objectives.
- You can also dig faster than other classes.
- And you can repair vehicles!
- The Sapper/Combat Engineer is a very situational role in Squad but is also one of the most important roles depending on the game mode.
- There are two different kinds of explosive specialists.
    - First the Sapper for the insurgents and militia faction. The kit has 1 anti-tank mine, 1 C4 and 1 IED, and a binocular.
    - The Combat Engineer which is available to the US, the British, the Russians, and the Canadian forces has 1 mine 1 C4, a repair kit, binoculars, and a sandbag plus barbed wire.
- Both roles are not meant for direct combat, you are either in the backline doing logi runs, shoveling structures, and pushing FOBs with your team or you are in the enemy’s backline disrupting logistics, placing mines, or destroying FOBs.

[Back to top](#content)


### Mines
- You can place up to 10 mines on the map.
- If the limit is reached a mine has to be blown up or destroyed to place a new one.
- To hide your mines, you can dig them into the ground with a shovel by pressing left-click.
- The only way to disable mines is to dig them back out, use the right-click for that.
- The mines are marked with a white skull on the map to help your teammates to avoid them because they do not ignore friendlies.
- Place your mine on crossroads, bridges, or entrances to objectives to destroy enemy logis and light vehicles or to damage armored ones.
- Don't place your mines in the way of supply routes of your own team, backline objectives of your team, or areas with friendly vehicles.
- Hide mines with rocks. However, don't do that on asphalt roads as the rocks are sticking out and are spotted quickly. The rocks can also be used as a dummy to scare off drivers or to funnel them into another direction, where you placed mines.
- Place mines together in a line to blow up any vehicle instantly that comes across.
- Place mines behind and in front of abandoned vehicles, this way logis are taken out of circulation, and if rescued they get blown up.
- Use a disposable vehicle like a transport truck or a techie to get behind enemy lines and use it as an ammo dispenser for your mines. For the Sapper, I recommend a techie or a bike and for the Combat Engineer, you could take a transport, a scout car, or an MRAP to get behind the enemy. It is also useful to have someone with you if you are using a light armored vehicle. This way they can cover you and you will be able to shoot at vehicles while driving.

[Back to top](#content)


### C4
- C4 is an explosive charge that can be placed on the ground. It has a timer that takes 30 seconds to blow it up.
- The explosive has a killing radius of about 5 meters but deals only 75% damage to a radio.
- To fully destroy the FOB, you have to shovel the radio completely down which lets the enemy team lose 10 tickets.
- C4 also ignores walls and you can place them near the wall or below the radio to damage it.
- Spawn Hubs are also deactivated if the radio is damaged by 25% percent.
- This is visible through their model: at 75 HP it changes its model and at 25 HP the model changes again.
- You can also deactivate the spawn HAB if you can't reach or find the radio.
- However, the spawn HAB only takes 25% damage and doesn’t get deactivated if you place C4 on it, you have to shovel it a bit down so it will be deactivated also an enemy can just activate the spawn HAB again by just shoveling it for a few seconds.
- Since enemies will often push back to their FOB when it gets deactivated, have a teammate cover you while you destroy the radio. This way no one can spawn in if you both stay in a 30-meter radius of the HAB but the downside is that the enemy knows you there and will try to stop you.
- It can be stuck to vehicles which deals low damage to them and destroys any tracks.
- But for that purpose, there is another gadget that is only available to the Sapper: The IED

[Back to top](#content)


### IED
- IED are remotely detonated explosive devices that have a very large kill radius and deal way more damage than C4.
- You can place up to 5 IEDs at a time,
- They deal enough damage that the radio is destroyed immediately and you need 2 IEDs to destroy anything but a tank.
- Because you can detonate them remotely some people use them strapped on vehicles as VBIED. Bikes are most suited for these use cases as they only cost 1 ticket, are harder to spot, and are easy to maneuver. I don't recommend using any other vehicles for a VBIED as all cost 5-10 times as many tickets to use as a car bomb. The only exception is on invasion, where you have almost unlimited tickets as the defender and you can afford to lose some vehicles. Just don't use any logis or BRDMs as a VBIED because they are crucial for your team.
Let someone else drive your bike into the enemy radio or positions as they can stay on the bike until they reach the target if you are doing it yourself you have to exit the vehicle first and then call the IEDs. During this time you can be killed and your IEDs be shoveled down.
- Another powerful option to destroy FOBs is to place IEDs on the top of the commander drone. The commander can fly the drone directly into enemy FOBs, where you can detonate the IED and destroy radios precisely and most often unnoticed because the drone is very silent and hard to spot in the sky.

[Back to top](#content)


## Raider
- The Raider is a kit only available for Insurgents in Squad.
- The primary task of a raider is to apply pressure on the enemy when it comes to close-quarters combat. The raider is armed with a fully automatic, fast-firing PPsH-41, HE grenades for flushing out areas of enemies, smoke grenades for cover, field dressings for wounds, and a shovel for construction of deployables. This role can prove extremely lethal when clearing out rooms or tight spaces in urban areas.
- The raider should be the first one to enter a room and should be expected to die in the process. It is highly discouraged to use this role beyond urban environments.
- Close quarter combat is the strong point of this kit, not open fields.
- Your PPsH-41 comes with a high rate of fire, use this to your advantage.
- Always be on the constant move but remain cautious as well.
- Use your grenades to clear out rooms and small spaces.
- The immense recoil created by your weapon will prove difficult to control at medium ranges, fire short bursts to counteract this problem.
- Surprise attacks should be taken into considerations as well. By doing this, not only will you confuse the enemy, but fear as well, especially in tight spaces.
- Always keep your weapon raised during tight combat, quick reactions will save you in many situations.
- Always keep clear communication with your squad, update them as you sweep an area.

## Crewman
- The Crewman is a Specialist Kit available in Squad. Selecting the Crewman kit is necessary to gain access to many of the vehicle crew positions (driver, gunner, commander, loader) in the game.
- Equipping the Crewman kit grants access to many of the heavier vehicles in Squad. Infantry Fighting Vehicles and Main Battle Tanks require every crew position to be manned by a Crewman. Armored Personnel Carriers generally require a Crewman to drive the vehicle but only require a Crewman if the gunner is in an enclosed turret.
- There is also a Crewman kit available for Squad Leaders.
- Like other kits, the Crewman can be sourced from ammo crates and vehicles. The latter means that if a vehicle has the necessary ammo points, a player can switch to a Crewman kit to crew a vehicle. Note that light vehicles and Main Battle Tanks only allow the Crewman kit to be selected.
- The Lead Crewman is one of the Kits available in Squad. This kit is necessary for crewing APCs, IFVs, and MBTs in the driver and gunner seats. It basically is a Squad Leader kit with Crewman abilities.

[Back to top](#content)


## Pilot
- The Pilot is a Specialist Kit available in Squad. Selecting the Pilot kit is necessary to fly the helicopters in the game.
- Equipping the Pilot kit grants access to helicopters in Squad. Infantry Fighting Vehicles and Main Battle Tanks require every crew position to be manned by a Crewman.
- Players can change to a Pilot kit from a helicopter. This means that if a helicopter has the necessary ammo points, a player can switch to a Pilot kit to fly a helicopter.

[Back to top](#content)


## Mortar
- Mortars cost 250 points each.
- Only two mortars per FOB are permitted.
- Each reload (3 rounds) costs 90 ammunition (1000 ammo = 11 reloads)
- Right-click to view crosshair (decreases aim sensitivity). The numbers on the left are called milliradian. The numbers on the bottom (your compass) are called degrees/bearing/azimuth.
- Left-click to fire, you can shoot three mortars at a time.
- Mortars take 20 seconds to land once fired.
- Mortars have a minimum range of 50m and a maximum range of 1250m.
- What you're planning to hit is very important. From the time you decide to shoot something to the time you hit it there are about 40 seconds so don't shoot anything that's moving. Emplaced positions are best, HABs are the #1 thing you should be shooting at.
- Running a mortar squad requires a bit of work on everyone's part. Here's what you'll need:
    - A surplus logi that your team does not need. Mortars are a luxury. Do not make your team lose because you took the only logi.
    - Good FOB placement, and usually on a small/medium map (for rapid logi runs).
    - Mortars built in a safe/hidden and distant position.
    - People willing to shoot mortars all game.
    - Person willing to do logi runs all game.
    - People willing to spot/follow SL all game.
    - Valid and accurate targets.
- Team Structure
    - Name your squad "Mortars".
    - Keep the squad members to a minimum amount.
    - You'll need one person doing logi runs (for ammunition).
    - Two people shooting the mortars.
    - Spotters, preferably multiple fireteam leaders.
    - Multiple fireteam leaders are very beneficial. If you put a spotter and mortar in each fireteam, the mortars can work independently. It takes lots of weight off your shoulders as the Squad Leader.
- Make sure you're using a mortar calculator, you're not going to hit much without one. SquadMC is a great one, but you may want to check out some others.
    - [SquadMC](https://squadmc.ende.pro/)
    - [SquadMortar](https://squadmortar.xyz/)
    - [Minimalistic Mortar Calculator](https://mortar.sharkman.info/)
- Basic Firing
    - Mortars disperse by about 15-20 meters from where you aim.
    - This is not enough deviation unless you're shooting static objects.
    - You must spread the mortars out to be effective.
    - Keep in mind what your goal is (Suppressing a compound? Killing a HAB? Providing smoke cover?)
    - Adjust volume, spread, and type of shells to your team's needs.
    - Timing. Time your shots if necessary. Don't waste ammo if your friendlies won't be there for a while.
    - As a mortar Squad Leader, you must be able to see all rounds coming into your targets. So I suggest using a vehicle on the fringes of the map to get to a good observation point. The Afghan maps are by far the easiest to find a Forward Observing position (FO - Forward Observer) but most maps will have some type of high ground you can utilize - it's important to not reveal your location by being seen or firing your weapon unless it's 100% crucial.
    - Let your other SL's know that your mortar team is available for fire missions - and that they should use the num pad keys to communicate directly with your squad to request it. Have them put a marker on the map requesting a fire mission. From there confirm with the person requesting the fire mission what is there and what the target is. Once you confirm the mission, try to be in a position where you can observe the rounds falling if possible. Place an observe marker on the map centered on the location for the fire mission and direct your mortar team to "standby for fire mission, orient on observe marker, standby for mils."
- Adjusting Fire
    - Mortars, by their nature, won't always land directly on the target, which is to be expected. That being said, they are still accurate enough to take down HABs, vehicles, and even radios. If your shots are off, you'll have to adjust fire. Think about where your mortars are, and where they're landing. Telling them to add 10 milliradians will make the mortars land a bit closer, whereas moving one degree will cause the mortars to land a bit to the left or right. This all depends on the range of course, and you'll want to remember that even a half-degree at 1000 meters will be significant compared to a half degree from 150m. Adjusting fire takes some getting used to, and you'll get better with experience.
    - Add milliradian = mortars land closer
    - Subtract milliradian = mortars land farther
- Targets
    - Infantry/objectives = dispersed, conserve ammo (unless you have enough ammo)
    - Stationary targets = no dispersion, rapid-fire until out of ammo (if accurate)
    - The best target of all is a HAB. Taking down an enemy HAB puts them in a very difficult position, so long as you keep firing. If your mortars can hit their HAB, you'll usually be able to kill it, so long as you have ammo. Even if enemies stay inside and rebuild it (which is very rare considering how fast HABs will fall to mortars) you'll still be killing everybody else who leaves it, bleeding their tickets. Only two things can stop you: They find your mortars, or you run out of ammo.
    - Killing enemy mortar crews with your mortar crew is kinda fun, too.
- Complications
    - Height Offset - One thing to consider with mortars is the height at which you are firing. If you're firing from the top of a mountain to a flat spot on the map, then you may end up overshooting. Calculators such as [SquadMC](https://squadmc.ende.pro) account for height differences, but you may want to stick to flat areas just in case.
    - Degrees At Range - Say I'm shooting a mortar at 150 meters, then I aim right one more degree. There will be a slight change to where the mortar lands. However, if I fire at 1,000 meters and aim right one degree, the mortar will land significantly farther than before. This is something to keep in mind when you're adjusting fire and is a reason why you may want to use half degrees or quarter degrees.
- Having a dedicated mortar team with experienced players that understand what they're doing, good drivers that can stick to the route and avoid enemy ambushes to keep the supplies flowing, and good intelligence to feed to other squads from a few guys with optics/AT roaming around behind enemy lines can turn close games into clear wins. These squads are great because they can get players who would otherwise be lone wolves on an important task that contributes directly to victory.
- Always remember, there's going to be games where your mortars are just useless if your team can't get organized well enough to even use them and you keep getting gunned down trying to FO. You have to be willing to just say screw it, and just send your full squad into the objective when you need it.

# Vehicles

- To enter, exit, rearm, or switch kits off a vehicle, press and hold F.
- To switch seats, press F1 to F12. For a short moment, you will also see a list of the current passengers of the vehicle.
- Entering or exiting vehicles and switching seats inside vehicles is not instantaneous. The duration depends on the vehicle and the type of seat. This greatly reduces the effectiveness of soloing vehicles when a vehicle is flanked or ambushed. Either it will not be able to drive away or it won't be able to return fire instantly.
- To drive a vehicle, you must first claim the vehicle, you may then enter the driver's seat and start the engine.
- To start and turn off the engine, press and hold E. To be able to start the engine, make sure you have assigned a keyboard key to the vehicle control "Vehicle toggle engine" in the settings menu (default E).
- To maintain the current gear, press and hold ⇧ Shift.
- If you are a gunner and your vehicle has zoom mode, zoom in by pressing Q.
- If you are the gunner in specific vehicles you can stabilize your view by pressing Z
- The WASD keys control traverse and pitch on all vehicle turrets except for the KPVT, NSV-T, PKT turrets, and open turrets.
- Most vehicles also carry some amount of supplies. While the vehicle is stopped, any teammate in or next to the vehicle can load and unload the supplies using the radial vehicle interaction menu (press and hold F). Multiple players can load or unload the vehicle faster than if it were just one player.
- Unoccupied vehicles that are not within 150m of a Rally point or a Forward Operating Base will start to burn after 20 minutes.
- Different surfaces provide different amounts of traction and rolling resistance, referred to as Physmat. This means that going off-road will make a vehicle much slower than staying on the roads. Wheeled vehicles are more affected by this than tracked vehicles.
- Wheeled vehicles will roll much better on asphalt than on mud or snow. The lowest resistance is on asphalt, concrete, and solid wood. Gravel comes next, then dirt and grass. Sand and snow are where you're really starting to suffer. Lastly, mud has the highest resistance and is terrible to drive on.

## Vehicle Types
- This is the vehicles section of the guide, which gives a brief description of each vehicle type in Squad.
- AFV: Armored Fighting Vehicles - This can be any armored and armed vehicle: MRAPs, APCs, IFVs, MBTs.
- APC: Wheeled with .50 cal (Armored Personnel Carrier). APCs are usually wheeled, some have tracks, but they have a smaller gun than other vics. Medium armored with armament that can pierce other APCs and other vehicles with lower armament ratings; can carry a squad of men; includes Stryker with CROW, BTR-80, and most MT-LB variants. Have 600 ammo for resupply. APCs are mainly just battle taxis (motorization of infantry): Bring up infantry close to the fight and leave, extend the infantry’s range and give them light armor against small armed threats (aka other infantry).
- AT vehicle: Techie/MRAP w/ ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missile)
- Helicopter (Helo) - a flying machine used for resupply, FOB creation, and troop transport. Can also do recon or provide light CAS, but weak in terms of armor and armament. More on helicopters in the next chapter: [Helicopter](#helicopter)
- IFV: Tracked or wheeled with canon above .50 cal (Infantry Fighting Vehicle). The Russians have a BTR IFV (wheeled) and a BMP IFV (tracked) (Russian Armored Transporter). IFVs are usually tracked, with a lot of good offensive options. Medium to high armor with armament that can pierce other IFVs and other vehicles with lower armament ratings; some have HAT capabilities with ATGM systems (Anti-Tank Guided Missile); include Bradley, MT-LB with 30mm, and BTR-82A. The difference between APCs and IFVs is a little bit of a gray area. Both are a subclass of AFVs and the APC usually has a smaller .50 cal gun, whereas an IFV has a 30mm gun. IFVs are intended to support MBTs (armor units) with Infantry (mechanization of infantry): MBTs need infantry to defend them from OPFOR infantry, but to keep up the speed and the intended combat intensity these infantry units need something better than a standard low-cost APC. So this is where your (mostly tracked) IFV comes in handy. IFVs can hit harder and take more of a beating so they are perfect for being on the frontline.
- Logistics Truck - an open-roofed truck with supplies in the back; includes the Ural and M939 variants that can hold 10 people and 3000 supplies.
- MBT: Tracked with one big fat gun (Main Battle Tank). Heavily armored fighting vehicles that carry heavy armaments able to pierce other MBTs and other vehicles with lower armament ratings; sacrifice men capacity for armor and armament; include the M1 Abrams and T-72 B3.
- MotorBike - fast and agile bike that can glitch out sometimes and get you killed; holds 2 people
- Scouts are wheeled vehicles with a small gun
- MRAP: Four-wheeled with .50 cal or 7.62mm, fast and lightly armored (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected). Have 150 ammo for resupply.
- Armed Technical - a small pickup truck with a gun on its load bed. Some variants have basic armor.
- Logistics Technical - a small truck that carries supplies; holds 5 men and 1400 supplies.
- Transport Technical - a small truck that can carry a lot of men; includes the Transport Technical that holds 8 people. Can also carry a small supply of ammo for resupply.
- Transport Truck - an open-roofed truck that can carry a lot of men (compared to the other vehicles); includes Ural and M939 variants that can hold 18 people. Also carries a bit of ammo for resupply.

## Vehicle Basics
- Any vehicle other than scout ones needs a minimum of 2 Crewman roles to operate effectively. A 3rd vic member can be a HAT, LAT, or Medic, and should be on the commander seat of the vic to mark targets and keep a lookout.
- Protect your vic and don't fall for your team's pressure. Sometimes you have to make decisions to save the tickets of your vehicle or to make sure your team won't lose the asset and people will get mad at you for "not helping the team". It's not common, but it happens and you must not fall for it. YOU are the one using the asset, you should know where you can put it and where you can't. If a situation feels disadvantageous, leave and search for a better position to engage. Your team located an enemy tank, but your hull is at 35% and you can't engage at long range? It might be a bad idea to engage that vehicle at this time. It's a map with 2 tanks on each side and the other allied tank got completely destroyed without hitting any of them? Play defensively until an opportunity arrives. Decision-making is important in these sorts of high-value assets because losing them is costly for your team. You don't want to give your enemy tank free rein to destroy your team by losing your tank in a stupid situation/stupid call from an SL. You might not be as useful as you start practicing but, in time, you will learn the dynamics of tank warfare and you will be much more useful to your team than just wasting your tank after 5 mins of a match.
- Always try to get a fully manned MBT. More eyes in the field, more protection against HATs, more people to fix it up should you get in a bad situation, more people to dig up repair stations in FOBs. There is no reason to not run fully manned tanks, not doing it is just making your asset weaker, especially if you have friends/groups/clans that can play with you.

## Training
- In Jensen's Range there is a vehicle hitbox reference table next to the line of vehicle tents. Use this to see where vehicles can be damaged. Each vehicle has unique armor zones and weak zones.
- Practice/play all roles within a tank, also practice different tanks. If all you want is to be a gunner, you might not understand what the other crew members need to be doing and it might lead to frustration and defeat. Try to find a group/clan to play together often, it will increase your effectiveness by far.
    - Both T-72s are very slow when reversing, the cannon round goes off a bit to the right and its auto-reload is slower than the manual reloads of the Abrams, for example, but its low profile, it only requires a crew of 3. The top gunner is remote and it's quite fast moving forward (for a tank, that is).
    - The Abrams is very loud and high profile, very easy to distinguish, the range finder is a bit weird, but the front armor has a greater chance of deflecting rounds than most tanks and its top gunner is also remote.
    - Challenger has a weird measurement of range. It can't fire backward effectively and it’s quite high profile as well, but it's quite fast moving in any direction and very maneuverable.
    - Leopard has a very different ranging system that gives him quite big of an edge in long-range engagements but it's awkward to use at close range, but it has a somewhat lower profile than most tanks
    - The T-62 is very exposed, but it’s very low profile, making the least noise, it’s fast, requires only 3 Crewmen and of all tanks, this is the one with the greatest chances of deflecting rounds directed at its turret.
- Also, practice all tanks so you know their strengths/weaknesses and how to range/maneuver them.
- Good drivers are good gunners. Swap roles mid-match if possible so you both understand each role.

## Moving Around
- If you have friendly infantry nearby it doesn't mean you are safe, ALWAYS keep moving.
- It's a good strategy to keep vehicles out of the city because they're easy targets.
- Urban environments are dangerous - Ideally, you want to have the range on your side, since it's one of the greatest advantages of a tank over most enemies and urban environments are the antithesis of that (also true for real-life engagements, MBTs don't usually go inside a city unless it's a hard push of combined arms, meaning they have the support of infantry/air and information about enemy positions). Unless you are supported by a lot of infantry, it is usually best to secure the outskirts of a city/town/village, providing fire support to the troops going in. If you have to get inside an urban area, search for areas where you can put some distance between you and buildings/enemy vehicles to not be surprised by ATs/enemy vehicles. Whatever you do, urban areas are bad and the chance of being tracked/destroyed is higher than in any other environment. A somewhat decent strategy in urban areas is playing defense of a point while your team attacks the next point, it allows you to pick a position and turn the engine off, playing overwatch of a certain road/building/point.
- Don't stay in the same area for too long. This is especially important if you know that there are enemy MBTs/IFVs active and relatively close to you. Your gun makes A LOT of noise and when you start mowing down enemies, they will know you are there, they will mark the shit out of your position. One of the strategies used also in real life is finding a position to fire, fire a few rounds and reverse to a safe spot using smoke, then relocate to a new spot. Standing still is just making it easier for your enemy. There are situations where you can stay longer. For example, you have put pressure on a capture point, your troops are moving in and the enemy is retreating. Stay awhile to make sure no one tries to take the point back from another direction, then move as soon as possible.
- If you are not relocating soon, turn the engine off. Tanks have a loud gun and a loud engine, try to reduce your signature as much as you can. If they can't see you and can't hear you, you have the element of surprise, which is a decisive factor in many engagements.
- Move as fast as possible whenever possible to avoid enemy fire.

## How To Identify A Vehicle
- Make sure you properly identify nearby vehicles. Good callouts will help your team to respond better.
- Anything 30mm and up is considered an IFV, while anything below (e.g. .50 cal) is considered an APC. Most of the time at least.
- Vehicle sounds are pretty distinctive in Squad. Learn to recognize as many vehicles by sound as possible.
- A lot of people see a vehicle and simply shout "BTR" only for an MT-LB, or a Stryker to show up. Use the information below to determine what you're looking at.
- Don't spend time trying to determine the exact vic you're looking at. It's good enough to call out "IFV" or "APC".
- Call enemy vehicles out via squad voice comm. If you're SL relay callouts to other SLs and the Commander.
- If you're an SL/FTL mark the vehicle on the map for everyone to see.

How to read the information below: If you see a vic that looks somewhat like a tank (since it has the hull of a tank), check if it has wheels or tracks. If it has wheels, check how many wheels it has on its side (2 or 4). If it has 2 wheels it’s most likely an APC. If it has 4 wheels, can you determine if it has a .50 cal or 30mm gun? If it has a 30mm gun it’s most likely an IFV. 
Also, if it has tracks, is the gun longer or shorter than the hull? If its gun is shorter than its hull it could be an IFV or an APC. 
If in doubt, rather say IFV than APC since an IFV poses a bigger threat and usually has stronger armor. Better to be cautious and call out a stronger/better-armed vehicle class, so your SL/Commander can respond appropriately. 

- What you see = what it most likely is (and what you should call out)
- Tank (does it have tracks or wheels; if it has wheels, how many per side?)
    - 2 Wheels/Side = APC 
    - 4 Wheels/Side = APC or IFV
        - .50 cal gun = APC
        - 30mm gun = IFV
    - Tracks (if it has tracks, is the gun longer than the hull or not?)
        - Gun Is Shorter Than Hull = APC or IFV
        - Gun Is Longer Than Hull = MBT
- Big-Ass Off-Road Car = MRAP
- Truck
   - Boxes on its load bed = Logi 
   - Empty load bed = Transport truck
- Pickup = Technical/Techie
    - gun on its load bed = armored technical
    - boxes on its load bed = logi technical
    - empty load bed = transport technical
- Motorbike = no differentiation needed; all motorbikes have the same HP
- Helicopter = no differentiation needed; all helicopters have the same HP

## Engaging The Enemy
- Use the right ammunition types for the right target, fragmentation is great for infantry but isn't going to do shit to vehicles.
- MBT vs MBT - I see so many people get tank fights totally wrong and it leads to their demise. If you are playing a T-62 and your enemy has a Leopard, for example, you must know how to engage. Otherwise, things will go bad for you. First of all, IF YOU CAN, engage the other MBT at long range. If they can't see you and you can make the first shot, it's a big advantage and you should use it when you can. If the engagement is at medium or small range (less than 500m I would say), focus on disabling it. Usually, it goes like this: tracks/engine, turret, boom. Why? Why shouldn't you just shoot whatever and take them down, especially if 4 good shots are all you need to take one down? Because you might be in a situation where you were engaged first and the only advantage you can have in this situation is disabling that tank and outmaneuvering it. If they can't move, you can relocate to a better position where it will take them more time to acquire you and shoot you down, also they are a sitting duck for anything else in your team to disable it. Disabling turrets is not as easy as tracks/engine, but it's the biggest advantage you can have, maneuvering on them and finishing the job is a lot easier if you can manage that. Also, unless you engaged first, KEEP MOVING. This is very important and people don't do it enough. The gunner needs to practice firing while moving because standing still is like asking to eat enemy rounds. If they already see you, why make it easier for the enemy by being a stupid target practice? If you can put a hill/rocks/buildings between you and the enemy, even better, you can use the smoke strategy I've mentioned earlier to keep engaging/disengaging as needed and might not need to move as much.
- You can't really help infantry unless you kill the enemies’ armor first or know they won't be in combat near you. The IFVs are called IFVs for a reason, so it's smart to let them kill infantry instead and protect them from enemy armor.
- When using tanks stay away from objectives and flank. Knowing what roads the enemy armor might take or places they will go to helps (you'll learn this with map knowledge and just trial and error).
- Also, avoid being spotted or being too close to enemy infantry, these can ruin a tank run.
- Talking to command and asking for enemy armored locations helps but it is usually called out anyways for all squads to know (and marked on the map). Use this knowledge to guess the enemy's intent based on their location (to objectives or friendly's). This will aid in your survival and their death.
- Tanks can ram and move smaller vehicles.
- A Stryker can ram and flip a BTR provided that the BTR is also moving forward.
- Kill infantry with HE rounds and machine guns.
- Check your map. Anything relevant will probably appear there right.
- Use your zoom optic.
- Try to spread armor squads out so you don't lose both your tanks in one spot. This also allows your tanks to cover more ground and kill more infantry.
- Don't fire the ATGMs first they take too long to reach their target and you may be hit with two tank shells by then. Primarily use ATGMs against helicopters.

## How to Destroy/Disable A Vehicle
- Try to hit the tires or tracks first to disable the vehicle. It's easier to kill especially armored vics if they're standing still since you'll most likely need multiple rounds to kill it.
- If the vehicle is unarmored (e.g. logi truck) you can try to hit the driver as well to disable it.
- Once an armored vehicle is disabled, aim at the side of the vehicle to hit the engine. MBTs have their engine in the back so you can hit their rear too.
- Avoid shooting AFVs head-on. The front has the strongest armor and is often designed to deflect projectiles.
- Never use frag rounds on AFVs. Use them only on infantry targets.
- Use LAT primarily for unarmored vehicles and to immobilize APCs/IFVs/MBTs by disabling tracks and wheels.


### Truck/Pickup/Motorbike: 
- Weak spots to focus on:
	- driver
	- tires
	- engine (front of the vehicle; middle of the motorbike) 
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- Rifle/MG - primarily shoot at tires (~5 shots needed) and try to hit the driver to stop the vehicle
	- HAT (better safe your rockets for armored vehicles)
	- LAT
	- .50 cal
	- 30mm
	- IED, Mines, C4 (better safe those for AFVs)


### MRAP
- Weak spots to focus on:
	- tires
	- engine (attack from the side)
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- Rifle/MG - shoot tires (~35 shots needed) to disable the vehicle
	- HAT
	- LAT
	- .50 cal (focus on tires)
	- 30mm
	- IED, Mines, C4


### APC 
- Weak spots to focus on:
	- tires/tracks
	- engine (US/CA/UK: front of the vehicle, RU rear of vehicle)
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- Rifle/MG - only to destroy wheels (~35 shots needed) - if it has tracks, don't bother using a rifle at all)
	- HAT
	- LAT (needs ~4 shots to kill an APC)
	- .50 cal (tires only)
	- 30mm
	- IED, Mines, C4


### IFV
- Weak spots to focus on:
	- tires/tracks
	- engine in the front half of the vehicle (attack from the side of the vehicle)
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- Rifle/MG - only to destroy wheels (~35 shots needed) - if it has tracks, don't bother using a rifle at all)
	- HAT
	- LAT (needs ~5 shots to kill an IFV)
	- .50 cal (tires only)
	- 30mm
	- IED, Mines, C4


### MBT
- Weak spots to focus on:
	- tracks
	- engine in the rear of the vehicle (attack from side or rear)
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- HAT
	- LAT (only to disable tracks; you'd need to ~12 LAT shots to kill a tank, so get some support)
	- 30mm
	- IED, Mines, C4


### Helicopter
- Weak spot to focus on: tail rotor (you'll need around 30-36 rifle shots to disable the tail rotor)
- Weapons to use against this vic:
	- HAT
	- LAT
	- 30mm
        - Rifle (aim at tail rotor only)

## Damage and Repair System
- Engines, tracks, wheels, ammo can, turret can all be damaged and have different effects on the vehicle.
- Damage has an angle of incidence, meaning how square you hit your shot matters. A nice perpendicular angle to your target on a weaker armor spot matters big time. A shallow angle shot will cause your rocket to bounce off. Dark black smoke means you got a good hit on enemy armor.
- Do not get out of your vehicle to repair it until you are back at a friendly HAB or at least have cleared the area
- Ask other SLs to make a repair station so you don't have to go back to main.

# Helicopter 101

- For the love of god load up Jensen's Range again and practice taking off, landing, and flying helicopters. Do it fast and quickly, get good at it, THEN FLY IN AN ACTUAL GAME.
- Name your squad HELI so every SL knows what you're doing.
- Assist with the back cap - On maps like Gorodok, the first couple of back cap points can not only be far from main but also far from each other. After you drop a squad at the midpoint/get a HAB setup, drop a fireteam or a buddy team at each of the back cap points. Speed of back capping is key in RAAS. This frees up your other maneuverer elements to screen for the main force and allows your team to know about that key center point a few seconds or even minutes faster than the other team.
- Be a champion for airlifts and logistics support - A good commander is going to be focused on both logistics, and coordinating the main effort. Don't wait for him to tell you what he/she needs, if you see an opportunity to airlift a squad or set up a HAB let them know what you intend to do and then do it. Your commander will appreciate having another squad keeping a birds-eye view of the battle, and it will take that pressure off other SLs so they can focus on coordinating their fireteams.
- Gather Intel - The general rule of thumb is that your heli squad can have a max of three people. If that is the case, give both your gunner and your Copilot FTL. Between the three of you, you can mark enemy HABS, armor, and troop movements. The drone can only be up in one area for 15 minutes at a time. You can be anywhere.
- Master the J-Hook - Go on the training server and use the admin commands to change the map to whatever you want to practice on. If you can pull off a quick J-Hook turn into a landing in a small area, you will be much harder to hit, and the squad your transporting has a much higher chance of surviving the journey
- CAS - This might be an unpopular opinion, but I do think that there are two situations where the current helicopters can provide some sort of close air support.
    - Taking out enemy logistics trucks - If you spot one, and are confident it's not being escorted by any armor, it is quite possible to pull up alongside and shoot the driver out of a logi truck. We have all been in games where logi trucks are left all over the map, people generally don't take the time to go back and get them when they are lost. If you see an opportunity to paralyze the enemy's flow of supply, take it.
    - Attacking Mortar FOBs - Mortar FOBs are usually very hard for infantry to get to, and can be devastating if manned by a coordinate crew. If you spot one, you have a decent chance of being able to silence those mortars and mark the FOB for an A10. If you're feeling saucy, keep a Combat Engineer in the bird with you so you can insert him on the FOB once you have killed the mortars.
- Helicopters are great at logistics (transport BPs, ammo, troops) to a central point. From there logis can distribute supplies to (stealth) FOBs.
- A Heli is a flying Logi that can build FOBs anywhere and get from point A to point B faster than any truck. Make sure to grab a non-SL player and coordinate with other SLs on where FOBs are needed.
- In the beginning of the game ferry a squad to the mid-flag and help them with your supplies to setup a FOB.
- During a game bring supplies to the front. Again, coordinate with other SLs where supplies are needed the most. 
- Always take the initiative and communicate with other SLs/Commander. Ask what they need and where they need it. But always try keep your Heli safe. 
- Increase your in-game FOV or use TrackIR/Opentrack for additional situational awareness. 
- Flying 101
    - Collector at 45% = hovering
    - Pitch at 12-15% up/down = max speed without losing altitude (if the pitch is at 80-90 degrees the heli will crash)
- Heli binds

# Squad Leading

The Squad Leader is a command and support role whose primary responsibility is to lead his squad of up to 9 players in coordination with other SLs to accomplish their team's objectives. It is available to all factions. 

[Back to top](#content)


## What is a Squad Leader?
- A Squad Leader is a player who creates a squad and is assigned the Squad Leader role and thus accepts the responsibilities that come with it. The role is the most demanding in the game and requires a firm knowledge of the game mechanics and a willingness to be vocal and to be directly in command of 8 other players. You set the initial mood in the squad from serious and focused to joking and relaxed and determine the amount of BS that you tolerate from your squad members. Don't underestimate this as it has a direct consequence on your own enjoyment of the game.
- Your role is to communicate with other SL's and form a simple plan for the first minutes of the game, consisting of which squad uses what assets and takes care of what responsibilities both initially and throughout the match, like setting up FOBs, capturing each of the neutral flags and contesting the enemy forces.
- Then you communicate the part that is relevant to your squad to them and start the game by getting into action in your designated vehicles.

[Back to top](#content)


## Squad Leader Meta
- How to win a match? - Drain the enemy team's ticket count to zero.
- What's the best way to do that? - Capturing flags yields a net 70 tickets for your team (-10 for the enemy, +60 for your team).
- How to capture a flag? - Members of your team need to control both the offensive and defensive flag.
- What do they need to do that? - HABs!

[Back to top](#content)


## Creating a Squad
- Don't create a squad you don't intend to lead.
- Make sure you pick the SL kit. Big must. The Squad Leader needs this kit to place FOBs and other structures.
- If you want a certain thing out of your squad like "No Marksman" or "2 LATS, 2 Medics" then make sure to name your squad accordingly so if you don't have two LATs and 2 Medics then you can tell people on useless roles such as Automatic Rifleman or Marksman to switch off. Say for example "I need 2 Medics, 2 LATs and Riflemen, please. No Marksman needed for this map sorry".
- You want to make sure you have a good mix of roles, and not just a bunch of Rifleman and a Medic. This is how your squad could look like: 1-2 Medics, 1 AR gunner, 1 LAT, 1-2 Grenadiers and the rest Rifleman. 
- Consider having only one medic on your team, as the second medic's rifle only has iron sights. It often makes sense to add another kit with a scope to the squad instead, since iron sights are pretty useless outside of CQB. If in doubt, add another Rifleman kit, since it comes with an ammo bag. If you find that you need a second medic during the game, have someone switch kits on an ammo box or when they respawn. 
- Every squad should have at least a single Medic and AT. After your subordinates have chosen their roles, and you see none of them chose AT or/and a Medic then choose who will switch, by name (don't ask for volunteers).
- Keep in mind Fire Support category (AR, LAT, Marksman) has a limited number of slots per squad, you might need to ask your AR or Marksman to switch because others won't be able to). Specialist category (Machine gun, HAT, Engineer) is limited to 2 for the whole team, if you see two HATs in your squad order one of them to switch.
- Make sure every person in your squad has a microphone and uses it. Name your squad MIC REQ always. There is no point in joining a squad if you can't communicate with each other. It makes your life a billion times easier and your squad much more effective.
- Do mic checks on the way out of spawn once all the comms are cleared. You can also get your fireteam leaders to do them if you're busy with command chat.
- Do not kick players just because they don't have a mic. It is possible that a player is a mute and is not able to communicate via voice. Also, female gamers often get abusive comments when they use voice chat and prefer not to use their mic for that reason. Kick players only if they aren't following orders or if they give you and the team a hard time. Also, leave your text chat on and check if squad members are trying to communicate with you via chat.
- Kick troublemakers. If they don't want to play with you, you don't want to play with them.
- Don't be afraid to kick people from the squad. It is your discretion. Of course, use your own judgment and give them a few chances. Kicking people who don't listen or are disruptive or defiant will make your life easier. It will also ensure that people aren't questioning your orders excessively.
- You want to make sure you keep the AR gunner at the back and always have him stay in position and give support fire while moving up on the enemy. The enemy will usually think you're still there and be pinned by the AR gunner. You are good to leave a Medic with him as well. When you engage the enemy, have LAT and Grenadiers pop explosives at the enemy and then move up to flank. When moving, always have your Medic(s) in the back and spread out among the squad, you don't want both of them getting taken out at once.

[Back to top](#content)


## Leading a Squad
- The majority of the game will be spent with your squad, consisting of 2 to 9 people depending on what your role is.
- For a basic infantry squad the things you want to consider at all times are:
    - Is my squad being useful = are we doing something that benefits the team as a whole. The safest bet is to play objectives, but for example, flanking is very effective, as long as it's done in a way that doesn't jeopardize the active flags. This means that if you are doing a flank that has turned into a prolonged fight, you may need to cut your losses and fall back if the team is losing the critical objective fight behind you.
    - Does my squad have a relevant spawn point = keep those Rally Points updated and away from the enemy's hands. Walking another 10 seconds to place one is a lot better than losing it because an enemy flanked your position and accidentally hit it. Remember FOBs benefit the whole team, but placing one just for you might block others from placing an even more useful one. Communicate with other SLs.
    - Could we be doing more? = Always try to use all your assets to their fullest, this means both vehicles and players. If you're having a more silent period and are happy with your defense perimeter, offer assistance to others. Sharing is caring, this goes for transports, Medics, anti-tanks, anything you can spare, someone has a need.
- Keeping a track of these 3 things will have your squad being very proactive and being able to adapt to most situations on the fly. Remember that you're not the only one responsible for the whole squad, the other 8 players are still human beings capable of their own decision-making. To put it very simply, your job is to get the squad into a spot where you're contesting either an objective or enemy forces/assets, point them in a direction, and make sure they have a place to spawn on.
- Name your squad when you make it, something like MIC REQ INFANTRY gets the point across.
- Claim a logi truck in the main base and go make a FOB.
- Place your rally before you engage (requires a squadmate close by).
- Rearm your rally, you only get one at a time (placing another rally costs 50 ammo)
- Enemies can squash your rally if they walk nearby it.
- There needs to be attacking and defending squads, pay attention to what other SLs are doing.
- Nobody defending? Well, the enemies are going to notice that.
- Tell someone to go do a logi run if you notice stuff is getting low.
- Order people by name instead of asking for volunteers (also applies to other SLs).

## Leadership Tips
- Tell people what to do, don't ask, this isn't a democracy (that being said you don't have to be a dick about it).
- Manage your team's kits.
- You should have a broad range of kits, and you need 2 Medics.
- Tell people to switch kits.
- Don't be afraid to boot people if they aren't listening.
- Give clear orders, and mark them on the map.
- Don't be indecisive, make a decision and follow through.
- Don't micromanage, let your people use their own brains.
- Don't belittle or rage, cool heads are good SLs.
- Ask during the staging phase if anyone's new and go over basics with them

[Back to top](#content)


## Where Should You Go?
- Advance And Secure - AAS - Drop one soldier per flag until you get to one of the frontline objectives. Plan ahead to have enough space for two FOBs. Preferably go for the defensive objective (closer to your main compared to the enemy's). Never rely on other squads to take care of defense without being asked to do it. Either do it yourself or coordinate using the command channel.
- Random Advance And Secure - RAAS - squadlanes.com is going to be your savior here. Go to one of the possible locations for the middle flag (don't forget about back capping). If you find yourself away from the objectives, relocate as soon as possible. Ask for a Heli transport and leave one guy behind to drive the logi if you are a large distance away.
- Invasion Offence - Flank, go the long way around and make as many FOBs as possible around the first flag. Don't abandon your logi, keep it running or hide it somewhere safe, if friendlies nearby are in danger of being overrun evacuate the logi back to main. It's better to have the logi destroyed than abandoned unless you are low on tickets.
- Invasion Defense - Plan ahead and try to fit at least two FOBs next to the flags. You must get to the first (closest to the enemy) objective swiftly, it's easiest to win by stopping the enemy on the first point. Again, keep your logis safe and accessible, definitely destroy them if recovery is unlikely to succeed.

## SL Best Practices
- Having good spawns for your team is the #1 priority.
- Your main job is spawn management and big-picture coordination with other SLs. Low-level tactical coordination is far less relevant.
- Rally Points - One of the most important jobs you have as squad lead is making sure your squad has a good rally up at all times. Rally points have a cooldown of 2 minutes and require one other friendly within about 3m of you to place. They are free and give 10 spawns on that location. They provide freedom of movement and convenience for your squad. Put them down in buildings, in gullies, bushes, etc so you won’t get lit up as soon as you spawn. You can disable an enemy rally by getting within close proximity of it. Enemies can do the same so don't place your rally too close to them.
- Place rallies. Refresh your rallies. Always have a rally up.
- Make sure you resupply your rally point off of rifle bags and ammo crates. Recent updates have made rallies harder to spam. Start placing them further back from the enemy. You can also pick your rally point back up and move it to try a different angle of attack.
- Use your binoculars a lot.
- Every ticket and life counts. If you are unsure of a situation. Keep your squad’s heads down and only YOU peak so your whole squad does not get wiped by an MG on a ridgeline.
- Use transport time (logis or Helo) to relay INTENT and orders. For example, when getting a Helo drop I tell my fire support group to dismount, move for example northwest off LZ, and set a perimeter with bipods facing west while my AT fireteam helps with shovels on the Hab.
- Don't be afraid to ask your squad for their thoughts on a situation. I often ask if people know a good hidden radio spot or a nice angle of attack. Just make sure when you give a final order, people do not rebel.
- When moving across open ground, keep your fire support back and let the assault push. Then keep bunny hopping.
- Communicate the plan, mark the map, create spawn, put down rallies.
- Do the back caps, play defense, build FOBs/HABs for defense. From there you’ll learn.
- Don't shoot from the HAB/rally. Don't draw attention to our spawn area. In fact, get away from the spawn area. Stop spending your entire game within 20m of the HAB.
- If you are defending a point with your squad, be firm and tell them to stay around the cap point, if they start to run off and not listen to you, either (A) kick them from the squad or (B) ask them why they are running away. If they have a reason such as "I want to place a mine on the road" or "I thought I heard a logi over here so I’m going to check it out" then leave them to their own devices.
- It's your squad. You call the shots and play in whatever way appears most fun/effective to you. If squad members want to play differently, they're free to open their own squads. (Asking for tips and being open to suggestions can still be helpful. But don't let others ruin your playtime.) Just don’t be a pushover or else people won’t feel like there’s a leader.
- Always, always, always retain mobility for your squad. Whether that’s working closely with a friendly APC or keeping your squad’s logi/transport nearby at all times, you should always be able to quickly relocate to a different part of the field as the battle develops and your game state changes. Unless you’re fighting in an urban area or on one of the small maps, a squad that walks is a squad that loses more often than not.
- Do not tolerate racism/abusive behavior in your squad. It's (A) not funny, (B) obnoxious, and (C) makes the squad unfriendly. Kick those players right away. Also, report those players to admins.
- A lot of good squad leads make it look easy, and they always seem to know what they're doing. They don't, at least not all the time. You have to be confident with your decisions and sound confident about them. I've found myself in a lot of situations where I have absolutely no idea what to do. Don't freeze up and let your squad split apart. Act like you know what you're doing, even if you don't. You can admit what you did was stupid afterward. You'll eventually get to the point where you'll always have a backup plan or two in case something doesn't work out.
- Lastly, always have some mode of getting around the map. The worst mistake a lot of SLs make in this game is being off of a relevant point for too long. Learn to be able to disengage and retreat somewhere more important. If you are needed somewhere else, keep a logi or transport nearby, radio some armor or a helicopter for a pickup, and if none of that works and you have the tickets, find some way to die and respawn somewhere relevant.
- Backcap (AAS or RAAS) - Check your map, if you don't see any other squad placing their marker on the first flag, and no one said they are going to backcap then you are the one who will have to do it. Either order one of your guys to grab a scout car, or choose one squad member who will dismount from the logi and capture the flag, while the rest stays with you in the truck.
- That's your most important job as an SL, creating spawn points for your team and squad. The ability to place FOBs and HABs (also RPs) is the most influential tool you have at your disposal.
- The second most important part of your job is to keep your squad fighting close to one of the active objectives. You must be quick to relocate your squadmates when a flag is captured or lost, use your logi, alternatively ask for a Heli or APC transport to give you a ride (check the squad list and use direct radio to SL).
- Incompetent Squad Leaders often get snowballed after losing a struggle for one of the middle flags, all it takes is one enemy squad getting to the next objective before the defenders. The process repeats itself until all of the flags are captured.
- Don't expect other squads to go back defending on their own, you can only count on yourself. Other SLs must be made aware by you that they need to relocate their squads ASAP.
- Check your map constantly, the sooner you realize that a flag will be lost (or that your team will capture one) the sooner you can reposition your squad to newly relevant places on the map (notice that if FOBs are already prepared you can simply tell your squadmates to get shot and respawn)
- SLs from the other team will be doing the same thing, being quicker than them will yield you an advantage.
- Make FOBs and Rallies instead of getting into firefights like some ordinary grunt.
- Constantly analyze the map.
- Be more mobile than the enemy when active objectives shift (a flag is captured).
- Always watch your map - You see it in all the squad play-throughs but I constantly see 1 or 2 squad members off in the distance and I have to wrangle them back in. Normally this isn't the case with a well-organized squad but we still have new players so I don't put them at fault. But again, pay attention to your map there's more than one reason other than just having your bearings. You need to see where your team is so you know whether or not it's a friendly or an enemy. I usually pop my map up every 10 seconds to check where everyone is and I rely on my squad members to be my eyes on the battlefield when we're moving.
- Formation - you do not always want to be bunched up. Squad Leaders this is where checking your map is important. Always be aware of how your squad is positioned and formed and correct accordingly. I usually have my squad fan out a bit when we are sweeping. You don't want one RPG to take out your whole squad.
- HELP OTHER SQUADS - You need to be at the ready if there's a squad that needs help. Even if you're moving to the next position you may need to fall back to help another squad out.
- Be the teacher - If you have a new player to a MilSim or even FPS teach them. Don't just shun them and tell them to go do whatever. Be engaging and help them out. Give them tips, teach them how each role works and where they should be at all times. Make sure you give them the experience that keeps them playing and understand this isn't your average FPS. That you can't just lone wolf and that teamwork wins the game.
- Make it fun, but maintain control - At the end of the day, you're playing a game. Play tactically and engage with all members of your squad. Include them and offer suggestions for their roles ("AR take that building and take a Medic with you", "LAT feel free to go hunt that APC", etc). Talk with your squad, joke with your squad. If someone misses an important LAT shot, don't ridicule, perhaps they're new to the game. Embrace new players and offer help from yourself and other squadmates if they have questions. That being said, keep your squad on task. Continuously monitor what they're doing and if people are running off on their own without communicating to you (and you permitting) as to why turf them from the squad. Very few scenarios will call for a squad to split up, so have everyone stay relatively close.
- Talk a lot, and realize that you (kinda) don't matter anymore. - Your main priority is utilizing your squad to its best ability. You absolutely must communicate constantly with your squad and other Squad Leaders. Be polite and follow server rules.
- You will be looking at your map a lot, it's your best friend.

- Mark significant contact on the map for your team to see using your radio. In short, communicate and reinforce that your squadmates communicate to each other (especially locally, in fire-fights). Keep track of your squad's needs (ammo, Medics, ranges) and get them what they need.
- Politely ask other squads for assistance when needed. Sometimes you'll get it, sometimes you won't. Assist other squads when you can. If CAS is in the air and you have a target, reach out and see if they are available to hit an LZ. Report armor and FOBs regardless of other squads’ locations - this is information they need to know.
Ask for your squad's opinion sometimes - Be open to reasonable suggestions from your squad (especially when starting out). Maybe you're not familiar with the map and they know a good spot for a FOB. I'll usually ask my squad if they want to attack or defend if no other squads have made it clear what their intention is yet. If it's not a reasonable suggestion, shut it down.
- Play the objective - Don't be that squad out in the middle of nowhere chasing down a ghost FOB. Stay on cap. Destroy or defend the caches. Deviate from objectives to deal with FOBs on hard intel only, and you may even be able to send a few guys out to hunt it down. Objectives crawling with friendly and no enemy coming? Talk to other Squad Leaders to confirm they will stay and you'll scout around.
- Drop rally points a fair distance from the objective - Pretty self-explanatory.
- You're gonna fuck up - You will make bad calls. Your whole squad will get wiped. Look back at what happened and learn from it.

## Fireteams
- Ask if anyone wants to be a fireteam lead. This enables them to place and delete markers on the map, and also build simple structures (such as sandbags) in the FOB radius.
- When making fireteams I usually split my groups into fire support and AT/assault. Direct your fireteams as a unit, but split them when assaulting or defending to cover more ground or put the enemy in a crossfire.
- Remember, even though you are splitting your fireteams up, you are still ONE squad. Each fireteam should be able to support each other and work on the same major objective. In the example above, I could ask my alpha and Charlie squad to do a wide flank on the enemy position and catch the enemy push in a crossfire with bravo and squad 5
- If you don't want people to ask for Fireteam lead all the time a good thing to do is to split your squad into the two fireteams then make them give it to one another. Fireteam leaders can give Fireteam lead (FTL) to other members of that fireteam which should make it a lot less stressful.
- I find that assigning fireteam leads to competent people, makes communicating and giving orders much more effective than just automatically giving the role to a Marksman or AT. Again, it makes your life easier if your FTLs can round up their fireteams and move on your orders while you are doing other things on the map or command.
- Use fireteams for early warning if on defense or scouting while moving towards a flag.

## Building FOBs and HABs (Spawn Points)
- An SL can only place the structure foundation. Another team member with a shovel has to build the structure.
- Do not place your FOB right on the objective. FOBs in this area will be assaulted and need heavy defenses. The further away you can place the FOB the better. 
- Always build a backup FOB. Multiple spawn locations give your team more options to attack the enemy.
- Do not build a FOB inside a CP. Not only is it impossible for the enemy to miss, but you also make a fishbowl FOB where your enemy can use your own walls as cover and shoot you/throw grenades inside your spawn. You are wasting your time building it where you could be useful doing something else and you are bleeding valuable tickets plus the 10 points when the FOB goes down.
- FOB (radio) location - place it either inside a building for protection against artillery and vehicles or in foliage for stealth.
HAB location - needs some cover next to it (rotate with arrow keys to fit in tight places). Whatever is close to the HAB is gonna be protected by spawning soldiers, be it the radio or a flag. At the same time enemies attacking one, also attack the other for free.
- HAB (spawn bunker) costs 500 CPs while an ammo box goes for 100, therefore a minimum amount of CPs required for a FOB is 600. Take an extra 100 for another ammo box away from the HAB. Take enough supplies to make 2 to 3 FOBs (1200 or 1800 CPs minimum).
- FOBs can be used offensively or defensively, allow for unlimited spawns, need shovels to be removed, allow for the building of base parts within 150m of the placed radio, cannot be placed within 300m of another friendly FOB, and require friendlies with shovels to place.
- For each FOB you'll need
    - 500 build for the HAB
    - 100 build for an ammo box
    - Ammo, as much as possible
- You build a FOB by placing a radio using the radial menu T. Then you can use the T menu to build other things.
- In your map menu options (right-hand side) turn on FOB Radius Indicators to see the full radius of FOBs, this will let you place them as close to each other as possible.
- You can make a quick FOB with just a HAB and ammo and it will function well depending on where you placed it.
- Fortifying a FOB is often a waste of time because some Sapper will just blow up your radio.
- You can wall off the radio with Hesco’s/barrels/etc. to keep a Sapper off of it, preferably in an enclosed room with one entrance.
- You can hide your radio in a bush or something, but it makes noise and a Sapper can find it.
- You can make a FOB far away and have it be for mortars, with a good crew they can do work.
- Emplacements are a mixed bag
    - TOWs are great against vehicles but really obvious and you can easily be shot out. Also consumes a lot of ammo from the FOB.
    - MGs can do work but again, you can't move and can be easily shot out.
    - Mortars are good, but you need an external calculator to use them effectively. Have logis or helis resupply them, if nobody is doing this you can always help the team by doing it yourself.
- In-game marks are not accurate, they are in bad increments for precision ranging.
- Always build more than one FOB. In Squad two is one, and one is zero.
- If you put your FOB into a building make sure the building has more than one exit. Otherwise, it will become a deathtrap if the enemy sits in front of the only door and shots anyone that tries to leave the building.
- Make sure in your logi you take 1200 build and 1800 ammo. Doing this will let you make two FOBs because it costs 500 build for a HAB and 100 for an ammo box. After that, you can dump 900 ammo on that fob and make another after.
- Make sure that your HABs have multiple exits.
- Don't drop your Logi after the first FOB, use it to continuously construct spawn points when needed.
- A logistics truck is your best friend, and it can build 3 habs while still carrying a decent amount of ammo. Any point you intend to hold ideally needs 3 fobs, 1 on or near cap range and 2 on the flanks or to the rear of the objective. Keeping your guys in the fight when they die (and they will die) is your number one job as SL as you are one of the few people who can place spawns. 90% of flag losses occur because the enemy team has disabled the defending squad's spawn. Don't let that happen to you.
- Furthermore, Super FOBs are useless, as are most emplacements except in certain situations. A FOB the enemy knows about is a dead FOB. It's only a matter of time until it's airstriked or proxied. Multiple backup FOBs are infinitely more useful for this very reason.
- As soon as you have your spawn network built, work on getting your truck resupplied as soon as possible and keep it on standby, coordinating with helicopters is a quick way to do this if the team and layer allow for it. Don't get distracted by the firefight in front of you. Your squad can deal with the enemy. You need to keep an eye on the bigger picture and make sure the fight they're in is actually useful to the team overall and that they're in a good position to win it.
- The Building Procedure:
    - Choose a single squadmate to unload a specified amount of supplies (500+100 CPs needed for 1 HAB and 1 ammo box), and shovel the HAB up. 
    - Tell the others (and mark on the map) where they are supposed to go (create a defensive perimeter around the FOB or attack enemy positions).
    - Get out of the logi, hold T and select the FOB radio (1 o'clock), place it. When CPs are unloaded, place the HAB, and don't forget about the ammo crate. If enemy contact is likely, place a Rally Point 100/200m away from the HAB in case it's overrun, look at the map and order a specific member of your squad to come to you.
- Use the yellow "create FOB marker" to plan your FOB placement. The marker shows the FOB range, which enables you to create 2 FOBs with minimal distance to each other, as well as showing the area in which you will be able to place the HAB.
- Helicopters are not a great choice for stealth FOBs. They are loud and easy to spot. It's better to use a logi to build a stealth FOB.

## Team Communication
- Mic check at the start of each round. Ask your team if they have a mic.
- Ask if anyone is new to Squad. Help new players with the basics. A little help can go a long way.
- Keep your squad informed as a Squad Leader. I never have a squad member ask what we are doing. And if you do you are wrong. You have a mic and a squad channel for a reason. Let your squad know the plan so they can be one step ahead of you. Let the other SL's know what you are doing. Keep your squad members informed as to where you're going and potential contacts and always remind them to keep their eyes open and on the horizons. Your squadmates are your eyes and ears on the battlefield.
- Politeness goes a long way. "Please" and "thank you" should be your primary means of leading the squad. Call people by names to get things done. "Someone" will never dig that HAB and "someone" will never do that logi run. Bob the Rifleman will do both, usually gladly. You just have to ask.
- Getting people on board - Being a good Squad Leader in a pub group with a bunch of people you don't know and getting them to work together and follow orders takes some social/emotional intelligence and maturity. Most people (95%) know this is a team-based/highly communicative game and many are also new to it so they are in-fact seeking someone to take charge and give them orders. All you need to do is be cool about giving the orders out. Be nice, but also be confident, and understanding. Speak with a clear/respectful voice and be willing to listen to other’s ideas/advice. Do this and people will follow you all day without a second thought. The calls you make are secondary to how you deal with dishing out the orders themselves.
- Be clear with your messages:
    - "We’re going to back cap x then push off to y"
    - We’re going to be defending this round"
    - "spawn off y hab. Move south so we can get a rally then we will move on x"
- Ask your squad for advice. "I haven’t played this map as much as the last one. Where should we set up this HAB?"
- Start of the match:
    - Mark where you intend to go with move markers at match start. This is efficient nonverbal communication.
    - Place move markers on which vics you’re headed towards
    - Naming your squad after the asset you’re claiming may not be required in every server but it’s good etiquette to do
    - Take supplies in increments of 600, it’s cleaner for all of us when we build in the field
- During the match:
    - Direct Comms when possible
    - Mark your map and delete your marks. Keep a clean map
    - Don’t just use logi for transport.
    - Recover your vehicles if you lose them
    - Don’t blindly rely on other SLs to defend/set up Fobs
    - Keep command chat relevant and concise.
- Repeat contact reports from other squads to your squad if relevant. Inform other squads of contact if you see something they need to be aware of.
- Have fun and be confident. No one will listen to a Squad Leader who says: "um so maybe we can do this????? But I don't really know. Haha" even if your proposal and orders are absolute dogshit, say it with confidence and authority and people will listen.
- As above, intent is important. People will follow orders if they know WHY we are doing something. E.g "squad 5 is losing the northwest flank, bravo move wear and support them from the south side of the town." As opposed to "bravo go to the west"
- You want to be on top of your squad. Consistently let them know what they're doing. Tell them, as well as other squad leads that you're new, but you're trying to learn. The majority of people respect someone learning to squad lead and will be patient with you. Ask people if they want fireteam lead to help you mark enemy positions.
- Generalized Commands
    - Move out, Move up, Advance, Forward
    - Hold Position, Stay put, Establish a perimeter
    - Open Fire, Weapons free, Engage, Fire at will
    - Cease Fire, Disengage, Stop firing
    - Retreat, Fall back
    - Go dark (stealth maneuvers, to crouch and stay off the radar)
    - Radio Silence
    - Covering, Cover fire, Suppressing Fire
- You need to talk all the time as SL. Your squad relies on you to get the mic ball rolling. You'll find that if you're quiet and don't talk much, your team will usually be the same. So be talkative, have fun, don't be super serious without also having banter in pubs. Everyone is there to have fun but call out any shots you hear when things are quiet and act appropriately. You should also react when a squad member says they see or hear something. Don't just brush it off.

## Communicating With Other SLs/Commander
- Make sure your team has a commander! And listen to their orders. They are looking at the map and are usually Squad vets who know what needs to happen, when it needs to be done by, and by who. If they ask you to build a FOB on a point two points away from the active ones, it means they think our defense is not sustainable and are preparing to fall back to a defensible position.
- Make sure you communicate with command and other Squad Leaders. Use your direct comms (num pad) as much as possible, but relay important information to all squads. For example, I will relay the location of an enemy tank to all squads, as that can help anti-tank infantry to engage and helicopter Pilots to stay away. However, I will direct comm our tank squad to tell them what direction the gun is facing, or how many crew members are alive, etc. So they can engage effectively. Another example is when organizing an assault. You can directly contact another infantry squad and get them to attack from the north while you sneak into the cap and FOB from the south.
- Tell other SLs what your plan is.
- In regards to the whole team, what you want to do as a good SL, is to actively participate in the first-minute plan of action. Take whatever assets you feel like using and using them to the best of your ability. In most cases this means, you'll assign a couple of people as drivers/gunners where necessary and let them do their thing, assuming they have some experience with the asset and can be useful.
- The primary things you need to communicate from one SL to another are FOB and objective related. Building/losing a FOB and capturing/losing an objective are the most crucial, game-changing info you have to share. This allows for others to plan and move accordingly and make sure the whole team remains in the fight.
- Keep command chat clear of unnecessary information. This comes with practice.
- Communicate - As SL you can talk to other SL's with the default binding 'G'. Do this at the start of the game to figure out what squad is capping what to avoid wasting precious time getting to the front. It's also important to communicate progress and developments on objectives. I.e. let the other squads know if you're about to get overrun or conversely if you are attacking and need backup to take the OBJ.

## Squad Tactics
- Know when to disengage from objectives and do it quickly
- Order players to suicide-rush the enemy and respawn to quickly shift your squad to alternative positions around the map
- Know when to cancel a futile attack (e.g. lack of vehicle support in attacking very open objectives)
- Send and/or allow people that know what they're doing to flank, they will almost always kick over enemy Rally Points. Every enemy objective falls as soon as you take out their primary FOB.
- Flank, flank, flank - Never run at the enemy head-on. You need to learn how to flank and use the environment as cover. See that hill, use the other side as cover. Those bushes and crops, crouch all the way. You may think it takes a long time but I've helped a lot of squads by having my squad flank an enemy position. Flanking is the best tactic to use in most situations, you need to be one step ahead of the enemy and make sure that you have a rough idea of where they are at. This is the time when you want to tell your squad to hold fire to not give away your position.
- Keep your cool - As a Squad Leader, you need to keep your head straight. You're going to have bullets, RPGs, grenades all coming at you and sometimes from all directions. You need to constantly be thinking of the best avenues of attack and defense, where to place your squad members, you cannot freeze. Once you freeze and stop moving and stop organizing your squad in a firefight, you're done for. You need to keep the momentum up with your squad as well. Make sure you keep barking out those orders, where you want them to shoot, to move, to cover. As soon as you freeze up the enemy squad has already won.
- Don't let yourself be pinned - It's fine to sit in a position for a little and take some shots off but this is why flanking and moving is important. You don't want a squad to zero in on your position and not give you an avenue to get out. Make sure you keep moving, even if under fire.
- Break contact with the enemy (aka stop fighting them) if your squad is needed on another objective. Do not get stuck in one pointless fight. If you need to spawn shift somewhere else, have your team rush the enemies and tell them where they should spawn next.

### Offensive Squad Tactics
- Since this game bases its gameplay mechanics around real-world gunfight mechanics it’s unsurprising that some real-world gunfight tactics can be used against your foe with good effect. When using various formations it's important to consider the various needs of each formation. Terrain, dispersion, and concentration. You want to have as much dispersion as you can use without losing concentration. You don't want to be clumped up so that one grenade or full auto burst kills a bunch of your guys but you have to consolidate your guys so that you can overwhelm your opponents 1 or 2 at a time. To clarify, you want to fight them 5v2 then another 5v2 then kill the last guy. Not 5v5 in one big engagement. 
- LeapFrogging Formation - Split your squad into 2 fireteams. While team A moves towards the objective, team B covers team A. Once A stops (not too far away) they start to cover team B until team B overtakes team A and finds another good location to cover team A.
- Momentum - I see a lot of squads stop every time they make contact. A lot of the time if you are trying to get to an objective to defend or capture it's best to bypass, or smoke and push through. The best SLs I had are always playing the objectives aggressively.
- Flanking - One of the most effective, intuitive, and generally understood tactics in Squad is flanking. You should initiate a flanking move when an enemy squad reveals their location. This usually allows you and at least a few men the freedom of movement to execute a successful flank. However, it is highly beneficial to maintain the element of surprise! Tell your squad you are going in quiet and not to shoot unless they absolutely have to. Use a hill or building to conceal your advance and get as many guns pointing in the right direction and from the right place as possible before anyone shoots. This will maximize the effectiveness of the first volley and should be devastating to the enemy squad, allowing you to then push forward and take out their rally or FOB.
- Support fire - A slightly more difficult aspect of squad leading is to effectively utilize your MGs, Snipers, and RPGs. I've found the best way to do this is by splitting up your squad into 2 separate fireteams. Tell your support team (something like a Sniper, MG, and RPG) up on a hill that overlooks your other fireteam and their approach. The important part here is getting the 2 separate fireteams to talk to each other and communicating what they need and what they see.
- Scouting - When advancing, it's handy to send one or 2 guys out in front to check for ambushes and contact. Maybe the one guy dies but you can put a rally down, get him back and now you have a full squad and knowledge of an imminent ambush/enemy position, etc. The alternative is a full squad surprised by an ambush which is far worse.
- Stacking - (not related to clan stacking where one clan or group joins a team to completely dominate the other.) Stacking is the tight formation a squad gets in before breaching a door or wall and extremely effective in SQUAD as a way to break an opponent's defenses on an OBJ or FOB which is a very common occurrence in this game. If you go into a well-defended compound one at a time you'll find it's basically the opposite of what I mentioned previously about fighting them 5v2 then 5v2 etc and you end up feeding them 1 easy kill at a time. Instead, order your unit to stack up on you near to an entry point but in good cover. Put a rally down, then tell your squaddies with grenades to prep a frag and get ready to toss it over the walls. Toss all your frags and go in HARD and FAST this is the time to yell GO GO GO ! into your mic and jazz up your squad with a bit of adrenaline. Go in right behind the guy in front of you and DON'T BLOCK THE ENTRANCE. Everyone goes in guns blazing and finds a good point of dominance in the compound which they can hold and if all goes well, you take control of the compound and kill a bunch of baddies in the process. If it fails, spawn on the rally and get back in there or wait for another push, depending on how the situation looks.

[Back to top](#content)


### Defensive Squad Tactics
- Defending is all about denying the enemy to neutralize or cap an objective.
- So you're at a FOB or objective and you need to defend it. The most common thing I see in pub games is that the whole squad or a large portion of it stays physically ON the point or in the building they're defending. This is a mistake. You want to stop them from getting to the compound instead of letting them get to the compound and then trying to stop them from getting in the building. By all being in the same building you are limiting your observation of the surrounding area/enemy maneuvers and you make yourselves vulnerable to a possible frag through the window or door which usually ends badly. Yes, you need to keep a few guys on the point to (A) check on the status of the point (if it's being capped, etc) and (B) to obstruct and counter enemy movement through the capture area. For the rest of your guys, you want to tell them to pick a spot with good cover and a vision of the surrounding area. The next part is hard and requires reliable squad members but try and get your squadmates to pick a direction/alleyway/area to cover and take responsibility for. When done correctly this allows you to focus your observations better and cover any blind spots more effectively. Another way to do it is to have a few guys on point and have everyone else orbiting the position as a solid group.
    - It is often helpful to designate a couple of guys for rear security, I find that Medics are best suited for this role as they tend to then stay closer to the squad but generally out of harm's way.
    - Ambushes - If you know the enemy is coming towards you, divide into 2 teams, one team spreads out in front will be the team that engages the enemy when they approach. The 2nd team waits in the flank for contact and moves in to engage the flanks of the enemy when contact on the 1st team is made. This is called an L-shaped ambush.
- It's important to defend positions as well as attack. If the enemy takes your defense point you can no longer capture the point in front of it and this can throw a major spanner in the works for your team. If this happens, get back to the next defense point immediately, or else risk chasing the other team all the way back to your base which is no fun!

### Rush Tactic
- Squads rush towards the enemy’s first few flags to cause a capping delay for the opposing side. 
- This is possible in AAS and RAAS. For RAAS consult [Squad Lanes](https://squadlanes.com), to find the enemies team’s first few flags.
- Note: V10 added the stealth cap mechanic which allows one team to continue capping, even if enemies are on their cap point. [From the V10 update notes](https://joinsquad.com/2018/02/05/alpha-10/):
    - Changes were made to AAS flag capture mechanics, where non-capturable flags will no longer be blockable by the enemy. 
    - For example: if one soldier is in the capture zone of their team’s first flag and nine enemies are in that cap zone as well trying to block it, the flag will still be captured. 
    - Once they find him and kill him, the flag will (obviously) stop capping. 
    - This should severely reduce the “Rush Flags” meta, and shift the focus more towards the linear progression of moving from flag area to flag area, as well as having a proper supply train with FOBs and logistics. 
    - Blocking a flag is technically still possible if you eliminate the entire attacking force, but it will require more resources to do and is more likely to fail.


#### Rushing The Enemy's Flags
- You need a squad or two rushing to the enemy’s first few flags.
- Infantry backed up by armor is a great way to do this. Take over the enemy’s first or second flag, don’t let any enemy players sneak in and cap.
- This is a risky strategy but maybe a necessary one on some maps. If you run into smart counter-rushers they could wipe your squad. But if they know you’re going to rush they may not rush you as they’re concerned with having to counter-rush.
- Keep in mind, rushes can be broken and wiped out; in most cases rather easily if teams plan for them. Rushes are high-risk, high-reward maneuvers, hinging on the idea that your rush-squad doesn't get wiped out by the enemy.


#### Counter-Rushing 
- Counter-rushing means to prevent the enemy from rushing your flags.
- If you have intel or suspect that the enemy is rushing your first few flags, you have to protect them. If the enemy neutralizes any of your already captured flags, you won't be able to capture any more flags until the neutralized flag has been recaptured.
- To prevent a successful enemy rush, send a whole squad each to your team’s first and second flag to fight off any enemies that are trying to slow your team’s cap progress down. 
- Counter-rushing can be accomplished by a single “back-capper” that has to sneak into cap range and stealth cap. If this back-capper stays alive, they will cap the point even if a full enemy squad is on it as well. This is called stealth cap.

## Guerilla/Recon Squad
- Information is an extremely powerful weapon. Knowing where enemy FOBs are, knowing enemy vehicle positions, knowing about an incoming flanking squad can turn a game in your favor. This allows your team to distribute its forces more effectively and respond to threats faster.
- If you're doing recon only, your squad/fireteam should probably never have more than 2 players in (R)AAS due to the manpower limits. Whoever is doing recon, make sure they have binos, a rifle with at least 4x optic, and can mark targets (either a squad lead or fireteam lead).
- A guerilla/recon squad could be a 4-man squad mounted in a light vehicle (HMMWV, Techie) or on foot (sometimes with transport). SL, Medic, Scoped Rifleman, LAT, or Engineer. Operate behind enemy lines, disrupt enemy supply lines, ambush vehicles, and take out FOBs, while relaying additional information on enemy movements to the rest of the squad. This can be extremely effective if you know what you're doing. Besides gathering intelligence, focus on taking out light (logistics) vehicles and FOBs.
- If you focus on gathering intelligence, you can do it as a one-man squad in a light vehicle as well.
- Make sure to lock your squad if you're running a guerilla/recon team with 1-4 players max.
- Be in close contact with all SLs/Commander. Provide detailed information to your armor squad to help them hunt enemy tanks you have your eyes on.

### Strategy To Win Games
- As an SL focus on leading a defensive squad. We have plenty of offensive-minded players, but not enough people who are okay with defending back caps while the rest of the team pushes forward.
- Be aware of what's going on directly around your squad, and on the battlefield as a whole. 
- Slow it down. Take a defensive position first to repel attackers before pushing outwards at the right times.
- Squad is math: Setting a defense and attack element divides the numbers of the enemy. By that, they cannot focus on one point but two. As you are divided in your own team (attack and defense) it will be about who has the better FOBs (ammo, setup, position-wise) and options for supply.
- Another way to say it is that taking the points does not give you map control. Having map control gets you the points.
- Defense is really fun and you can get easier kills too since you are in cover, still and watching, whereas the enemy has to run to you, making themselves easier to spot in the process. Well, as long as your entire squad doesn't just sit in a single spot and waits to be flanked and killed.

## How To Use Helicopters
- Communicate with helicopter Pilots (direct comms). At the beginning of the match, you should be using helis to move an attack or defend fob up the map FAST. Don't just use them for logi runs. A good Pilot and good Squad Leader communication can easily win the game. When asking for a pickup, find a good spot based on the Pilot’s skill, and create a perimeter. Pop smoke to help the Pilot land and provide cover when you are mounting. Mount up fast and make sure your squad is ready to get on the moment the Helo lands.
- Communicate in command chat that you need a helo and check the ETA with your Pilot!
- Gather your squad before calling Pilot in.
- Control the LZ and make sure there are no enemies close by. Enemy infantry is a HOT-Zone. Enemy BTR is a DEAD-Zone!
- Make sure no one gets on the Helicopter before you are gathered and have given the order to board.
- Landing and boarding should be one process and shouldn't take longer than a few seconds!
- Use one colored smoke grenade shortly before the Pilot arrives. It's easier to locate you. If you got enemy infantry around and still go for the evac, mark the enemy with red smoke (if you got a Grenadier) and let the others throw smoke towards the enemy (between LZ and enemy). This way door gunners can orientate better and can suppress them while your LZ is somewhat covered.
- Make sure you pick a landing zone that's suitable to land. We can't pick you up inside the deepest woods. The easier to reach the LZ the faster the evac. The faster, the safer!

## Staying Sane
- Kick troublemakers. No one is entitled to be in your squad and you're there to enjoy the game like anyone else.
- Politeness goes a long way. Some jobs are plain boring, but getting a simple: "Thank you" as recognition is huge.
- Ask for opinions or suggestions. Your squad is there stuck with you anyway and someone will be happy to help. 
- Squad Leading is hard work. Enjoy yourself with a good beer or 6 or your beverage of choice.
- You determine the environment in your squad and the people that you want to lead. Don't let anyone walk over you, if you don't like the way someone acts, just get rid of them. No one is entitled to be in your squad or anyone else's if they're taking away from your enjoyment of the game as an SL. When you pick SL, you pick a certain amount of responsibility and gain the advantage that you can choose exactly who you play with within your squad. Use it. 7 people communicating and having a good time is a lot better than 9 people, out of which 2 are off doing their own thing, one is talking over SL and you're just getting pissed off at the game. You deserve to enjoy the game just like anyone else and dealing with horse shit behavior is not something I recommend doing too much.
- When things go sour and you get pushed back constantly and can't seem to get your guys to win a single fight... It's not your fault in many cases, if you condense Squad Leading to its core, you're a glorified Rally Point dispenser. Your job is to get your squad to a more or less tactically advantageous spot, point your squad in a direction, and then as they're grown up goddamn men they can make micro-level decisions by themselves. And if you're keeping your boys in a relevant area and the killing is just not happening, then it's too bad, but you're only one man and need some help from the squad to make it into an effective force. There are 8 other guys/girls in there and you're all just as responsible. Doesn't matter if you point the tip of the spear to the heart of the beast if the tip is made of marshmallows.
- Make them flank and call out important targets and positions where you need them to be (in very general terms). That's mostly enough. Micromanagement yields no benefits and is mostly annoying to both of you. They should know better where to be in a firefight. The only time you should call out individual members is when you need your vehicle for support somewhere or when you need a logi run or some shoveling needs to be done. Other than that, it's not worth the hassle - you should focus on keeping the morale up for the whole squad instead. Focus on the good things.
- When the blame game starts among the SLs or within the squad, I just have to say: "Settle down guys, we actually did OK this time, the other team was simply better"
- Bear in mind most players are not military. Give acknowledgment to your team and other players when they do what you ask. Something as simple as "cheers mate" or "thanks" goes a long way to building loyalty fast.
- Also when you first get into a match, already have a rough plan in mind and be ready to lay it out the moment your squad is full. Then everyone knows you are competent and will stick close to you rather than lone wolfing.
- It takes confidence and a decent amount of leadership ability but that is a learned skill and Squad is great for it. Listen to your teammates and help them out as best you can, you are there to direct and support them, not just bark orders.
- No matter how frustrating it gets, always keep your cool. When you are calm, so is your squad and a calm squad will think a lot clearer than one that is getting angry.
- Have a drink.
- A decent Squad Leader just makes sure the basics get done well. Get the FOB/HAB down, keep the rally up, give the squad opportunities to get the fighting done.
- Whenever you get a squad of finely chopped jello just piggyback off another squad. Because when individual manpower lacks, raw numbers compensate. "We're following and assisting squad 1" - because 19 people are way scarier than 4 guys who know what they're doing. And I'm all about that intimidation factor of making some Auto Rifleman realize his 50 round belt isn't enough and screams into the mic "full enemy team to the west" because let's be honest, when's the last time a Rifleman ever gave a proper enemy force count. Make it true for once ;)
- You can only do so much. Don't stress too much if a game goes to shit. You're the arm that guides the spear. Sometimes the spear tip (squad members) is not made of steel. Sometimes it's wet noodles. And at that point when every teammate goes 0/10, your leadership is irrelevant. First and foremost Squad is a shooting game. If no one in the squad is shooting enemies, nothing gets done.

## SL Cheat Sheet

### NEW SQUAD
- Squad Names: INF, LOGI, BACKCAP, MIC REQ, TEAMWORK, HELI, ARMOR (use specific vic name like BRADLEY, BRDM; be aware of server rules, especially squad naming/vic claiming rules; keep an eye on what vics your squad tries to claim)
- Kits: Medic, HAT/LAT, Rifleman, AR, Grenadier, CE
- give FTL to squadmates (ask FTL to mark enemy positions on map)
- coordinate strategy with other SLs
- let squad know what the plan is

### OBJECTIVES 
- build FOBs (w/2+ exits per HAB; build 2-3 HABs around an objective), place rallys
- capture/defend flags
- find enemy FOBs
- supply FOBs (fill Logi with 600 increments of build points for each HAB you want to build, rest ammo; e.g. 1800 build for 3 HABs and 1200 ammo per Logi truck)
- setup mortars and tell squad to use mortar calculator (e.g. squadmc.ende.pro)

### DO ALL THE TIME
- place a RALLY before engagements (rally can be picked up and moved; new rally cost 50 ammo; place rally away from HABs; INS can spawn on buddy rallies)
- check map; mark enemy positions on map
- mark attack/defend order on map for fireteams
- relay enemy armor positions to all SL
- check if FOBs have enough ammo/build
- keep your squad in the loop on overall progress, strategy updates, enemy vics
- keep Logi’s running and supplying/building FOBs; don’t leave them unused in the field; share Logi with other SLs or RTB)
- PTFO

### COMMUNICATION w/Squad
- relay the overall strategy; give frequent updates
- give each fireteam a task (attack, defend, scout)
- tell team not to shoot from HAB/rally if possible unless we're leaving the place for good
- address people by name if you want their help
- ask squad for help (e.g. FOB placement)
- lone wolfs: ask to return to squad or kick 

### COMMUNICATION w/other SLs, Commander
- get APC/helo transport to objective
- coordinate attack with other SLs (flank)
- request airstrike/artillery 
- ask other squads if they need support/supplies

### BUILD FOBs
- hide radio indoors, protected by HAB/ammo box
- place HAB (2+ exits, easily accessible)
- place ammo box
- rotate deployables with arrow keys
- INS can build 2 HABs per radio

### Build Points
- HAB 500 (100 INS)
- Ammo Box 100
- Mortar 300 (250 INS)
- Repair Station 500 (300 INS)

************************************************************************
# Commander

- The Commander's first objective is to lead their team and manage other Squad Leaders.
- Their second objective is to lead a squad of their own as a normal Squad Leader. The role is available to all factions, however, it differs slightly for each.
- The Commander role is the only role that can exclusively deploy Strategic or Tactical Support Actions for reconnaissance or firepower purposes.
- The Commander is one of the most important roles in Squad as the position holds power over every other player in the game. Players should follow their Squad Lead's orders and Squad Leads should follow the Commander's orders. Squad Leads who wish to talk directly to their command can do so by hitting Num 0.
- Commanders are chosen by a vote; to nominate yourself you must have 2 squad members and there must be at least 3 squads created. After one or more Squad Leaders nominate themselves, every Squad Leader gets a chance to vote for their preferred candidate. Upon being elected Commander, the Commander-elect's squad name will change to: "CMD SQUAD". Commanders can be re-elected after 300 seconds (five minutes). If a new Commander is elected, the cooldowns are reset.
- Commander's deaths are worth 2 tickets instead of the usual 1.
- The Commander is not available in the Skirmish game mode, Logar and Sumari due to their small size, which renders the strategic actions available to the Commander obsolete and at the same time overpowered, due to the risk of wiping out the majority of forces on either side.
- Delivering a weaponized tactical support payload against the enemy is a 4 step process.
    - A Squad Leader (possibly the Commander themselves) marks a location on the map using the radial menu to Request Tactical Support from the Commander. The request mark specifies a radius rather than an exact location.
    - The Commander has 1 minute to Accept or Deny the request. If neither is chosen, the request will expire.
    - If accepted, the timer refreshes and the Commander has 1 minute to Accept or Deny their decision from Step 2. Essentially this acts as a "double-check" or a "2-step verification" to ensure a mistake wasn't made.
    - Finally, if accepted again (the "double-check" or "2-step verification" passed) then the Commander can choose a Tactical Support Action and specify the details of the payload (its direction, how large the radius is, etc.)
- TACTICAL SUPPORT PAYLOADS FOR ANY FACTION ARE NOT 100% ACCURATE, SO BE WARY OF FRIENDLY FIRE!
- Keep in mind that just because friendlies are outside of the designated target area for a strike that they are safe. All offensive strategic Commander actions have a large splash damage radius, which can wound or incapacitate friendly infantry a large distance away.
- A Commander can keep their squad size very small to primarily focus on keeping the rest of the team in the loop on enemy intel markings, planning new FOB build locations, coordinating air assault drop points, using the UAV to mark and scout enemy locations, as well as providing devastating fire support through artillery and airstrikes.
- The Commander role could be used by a Squad Leader that still has a full squad fighting in offensive or defensive situations. This "frontlines" Commander would still be able to help augment the team through the use of his Commander’s actions and keeping each squad on task, but with a more direct engagement in the battle.
- Another way to utilize the Commander role could be used by a Squad Leader focused on Logistics and Building rear defensive locations with a strong emphasis on intel gathering and reconnaissance.
- If you (the commander) have a message to one SL, transmit it directly, and for the love of everything sacred say "Four, this is one" and wait for the green light to continue. Sometimes I (SL) can talk, sometimes you're talking over my poor scout party that's trying to give good intel for the fourth time and has to repeat it yet again, clogging up the frequency further.
- Commanders have to be aware of the rush meta and how to prevent the enemy from rushing their teams' first few flags. See [Rush Tactic](#rush-tactic) for more information.

# About

- This game has a steep learning curve and I had no clue what to do during my first few games. The in-game training only teaches you so much. So I started this document to write down my learnings and those from other players. I never planned to share this guide, but as it grew in size I realized that others might benefit from it as well.
- This guide contains the collected wisdom of many experienced Squad players from various sources. Their contributions are often copy-pasted into this guide. If you find content in this guide that you wrote I want to say "Thank you" for sharing your wisdom on the Squad Wiki, Reddit, in various manuals and strategy guides, the old Squad forum (offline now), Steam, YouTube, and other sources. You can find a list of most sources under ([Sources and Resources](#sources-and-resources)).
- To save this manual, right-click on this page in your browser and click on "Save Page As" to save this page as a .html file. You can also [download the complete Github repo](https://github.com/SquadFM/Squad-Field-Manual/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). The .zip file contains this manual as a text file. Links won't work unless you use a markdown editor with live-view.

See you in Squad!
